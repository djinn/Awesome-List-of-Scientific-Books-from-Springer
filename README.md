## Strategic International Management#strategic_international_management
### **Dirk Morschett, Hanna Schramm-Klein, Joachim Zentes** 


  A compact overview of the most relevant concepts and developments in International Management. The various strategy concepts of internationally active companies and their implementation in practice are the core of this book. The authors describe the particularities of international value chain activities and management functions and offer a thorough understanding of how Production & Sourcing, Research & Development, Marketing, Human Resource Management and Controlling have to be designed in an international company and what models are available to understand those activities in an international context.

In 23 lessons, a comprehensive overview of all key issues is given. Each lesson is accompanied by a case study from an international company to facilitate the understanding of all important factors involved in strategic international management.

In this third edition, all chapters have been updated, all case studies revised, new chapters and recent data were integrated.

## Intuitive Probability and Random Processes Using MATLAB®#intuitive_probability_and_random_processes_using_matlab®
### **Steven M. Kay** 


  ***Intuitive Probability and Random Processes using MATLAB®*** is an introduction to probability and random processes that merges theory with practice. Based on the author’s belief that only "hands-on" experience with the material can promote intuitive understanding, the approach is to motivate the need for theory using MATLAB examples, followed by theory and analysis, and finally descriptions of "real-world" examples to acquaint the reader with a wide variety of applications. The latter is intended to answer the usual question "Why do we have to study this?" Other salient features are:**


*heavy reliance on computer simulation for illustration and student exercises

*the incorporation of MATLAB programs and code segments

*discussion of discrete random variables followed by continuous random variables to minimize confusion

*summary sections at the beginning of each chapter

*in-line equation explanations

*warnings on common errors and pitfalls

*over 750 problems designed to help the reader assimilate and extend the concepts

***Intuitive Probability and Random Processes using MATLAB®*** is intended for undergraduate and first-year graduate students in engineering. The practicing engineer as well as others having the appropriate mathematical background will also benefit from this book.**


**About the Author**

Steven M. Kay is a Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Rhode Island and a leading expert in signal processing. He has received the Education Award "for outstanding contributions in education and in writing scholarly books and texts..." from the IEEE Signal Processing society and has been listed as among the 250 most cited researchers in the world in engineering.

## Fundamentals of Biomechanics#fundamentals_of_biomechanics
### **Nihat Özkaya, Dawn Leger, David Goldsheyder, Margareta Nordin** 


  This textbook integrates the classic fields of mechanics—statics, dynamics, and strength of materials—using examples from biology and medicine. The book is excellent for teaching either undergraduates in biomedical engineering programs or health care professionals studying biomechanics at the graduate level. Extensively revised from a successful third edition, *Fundamentals of Biomechanics* features a wealth of clear illustrations, numerous worked examples, and many problem sets. The book provides the quantitative perspective missing from more descriptive texts, without requiring an advanced background in mathematics. It will be welcomed for use in courses such as biomechanics and orthopedics, rehabilitation and industrial engineering, and occupational or sports medicine.

This book:

*  Introduces the fundamental concepts, principles, and methods that must be understood to begin the study of biomechanics

*  Reinforces basic principles of biomechanics with repetitive exercises in class and homework assignments given throughout the textbook

*  Includes over 100 new problem sets with solutions and illustrations

## Thermodynamics and Energy Conversion#thermodynamics_and_energy_conversion
### **Henning Struchtrup** 


  This textbook gives a thorough treatment of engineering thermodynamics with applications to classical and modern energy conversion devices.



Some emphasis lies on the description of irreversible processes, such as friction, heat transfer and mixing, and the evaluation of the related work losses. Better use of resources requires high efficiencies, therefore the reduction of irreversible losses should be seen as one of the main goals of a thermal engineer. This book provides the necessary tools.



Topics include: car and aircraft engines, including Otto, Diesel and Atkinson cycles, by-pass turbofan engines, ramjet and scramjet; steam and gas power plants, including advanced regenerative systems, solar tower, and compressed air energy storage; mixing and separation, including reverse osmosis, osmotic powerplants, and carbon sequestration; phase equilibrium and chemical equilibrium, distillation, chemical reactors, combustion processes, and fuel cells; the microscopic definition of entropy.



The book includes about 300 end-of-chapter problems for homework assignments and exams. The material presented suffices for two or three full-term courses on thermodynamics and energy conversion.

## Real Analysis#real_analysis
### **Miklós Laczkovich, Vera T. Sós** 


  Based on courses given at Eötvös Loránd University (Hungary) over the past 30 years, this introductory textbook develops the central concepts of the analysis of functions of one variable - systematically, with many examples and illustrations, and in a manner that builds upon, and sharpens, the students' mathematical intuition.


The modular organization of the book makes it adaptable for either semester or year-long introductory courses, while the wealth of material allows for it to be used at various levels of student sophistication in all programs where analysis is a part of the curriculum, including teachers' education.

In the spirit of learning-by-doing, Real Analysis includes more than 500 engaging exercises for the student keen on mastering the basics of analysis. There are frequent hints and occasional complete solutions provided for the more challenging exercises making it an ideal choice for independent study.

The book includes a solid grounding in the basics of logic and proofs, sets, and real numbers, in preparation for a rigorous study of the main topics: limits, continuity, rational functions and transcendental functions, differentiation, and integration. Numerous historical notes and applications to other areas of mathematics, and to physics, are given, thereby demonstrating the practical scope and power of mathematical analysis.

## Fundamental Astronomy#fundamental_astronomy
### **Hannu Karttunen, Pekka Kröger, Heikki Oja, Markku Poutanen, Karl Johan Donner** 


  Now in its sixth edition this successful undergraduate textbook gives a well-balanced and comprehensive introduction to the topics of classical and modern astronomy. While emphasizing both the astronomical concepts and the underlying physical principles, the text provides a sound basis for more profound studies in the astronomical sciences.

The chapters on galactic and extragalactic astronomy as well as cosmology were extensively modernized in the previous edition. In this new edition they have been further revised to include more recent results. The long chapter on the solar system has been split into two parts: the first one deals with the general properties, and the other one describes individual objects. A new chapter on exoplanets has been added to the end of the book next to the chapter on astrobiology.

In response to the fact that astronomy has evolved enormously over the last few years, only a few chapters of this book have been left unmodified.

Long considered a standard text for physical science majors, *Fundamental Astronomy* is also an excellent reference and entrée for dedicated amateur astronomers. For their benefit the introductory chapter has been extended to give a brief summary of the different types of celestial objects.

From reviews of earlier editions:


"… The wide range of expertise gives the book an authority that would be almost impossible for a single-author text ... There are other aids to the reader: worked examples ... starred sections in small print take the inquisitive reader beyond the general level of the book." (*Nature)*

*
*

“This textbook, suitable for a university first course in astronomy, is the outgrowth of a long and outstanding astronomical tradition in Finland, and the result of an extensive collaborative effort, which included also teaching and interaction with many people. … I highly recommend this book for class use … it will be useful for professionals as well.” (Bruno Bertotti, Prometeo, Vol. 24 (3-4), 2008)*

## The Gastrointestinal System#the_gastrointestinal_system
### **Po Sing Leung** 


  This book presents basic concepts and principles of normal gastrointestinal physiology and, most importantly, conveys an understanding of how to apply this knowledge to abnormal gastrointestinal physiology in the clinical context. The ultimate goal of this work is to let the readers have an integrated systems-based approach in order to be able to grasp knowledge on gastrointestinal disease and its management.

Human gastrointestinal physiology is the study of our gastrointestinal system that addresses the regulation and integration of major physiological functions, i.e. motility, secretion, digestion, absorption and blood flow, as well as immunity. The coordination of these physiological processes is vital for the maintenance of gastrointestinal health, and thus any dysregulation will result in gastrointestinal disease. In this book, the understanding of basic gastrointestinal concepts and principles are illustrated by scenario-based clinical case presentations, critical for bedside care and also for preparation for professional examinations, and for being able to deal with future developments in clinical care. In this handbook, the aim is to achieve these various objectives by covering the breadth of gastrointestinal system. The contents are, therefore, designed to fall systemically into three core sections, namely Gastrointestinal Physiology (Part I), Nutritional Physiology (Part II) and Hepatobiliary Physiology (Part III), with closely relevant scenario-based clinical case studies at the end of each chapter to help students learn to apply their growing knowledge of basic gastrointestinal science, in the clinical setting. Last but by no means least, we provide a wide range of multiple-choice-questions (Part IV) so that students can evaluate their understanding of the basic science in each area of the GI system and to develop the students’ ability to apply their knowledge to solving clinical problems.

## Statistics and Analysis of Scientific Data#statistics_and_analysis_of_scientific_data
### **Massimiliano Bonamente** 


  The revised second edition of this textbook provides the reader with a solid foundation in probability theory and statistics as applied to the physical sciences, engineering and related fields. It covers a broad range of numerical and analytical methods that are essential for the correct analysis of scientific data, including probability theory, distribution functions of statistics, fits to two-dimensional data and parameter estimation, Monte Carlo methods and Markov chains.

Features new to this edition include:

• a discussion of statistical techniques employed in business science, such as multiple regression analysis of multivariate datasets.
• a new chapter on the various measures of the mean including logarithmic averages.
• new chapters on systematic errors and intrinsic scatter, and on the fitting of data with bivariate errors.
• a new case study and additional worked examples.
• mathematical derivations and theoretical background material have been appropriately marked,to improve the readability of the text.
• end-of-chapter summary boxes, for easy reference.

As in the first edition, the main pedagogical method is a theory-then-application approach, where emphasis is placed first on a sound understanding of the underlying theory of a topic, which becomes the basis for an efficient and practical application of the material. The level is appropriate for undergraduates and beginning graduate students, and as a reference for the experienced researcher. Basic calculus is used in some of the derivations, and no previous background in probability and statistics is required. The book includes many numerical tables of data, as well as exercises and examples to aid the readers' understanding of the topic.

## Partial Differential Equations#partial_differential_equations
### **Jürgen Jost** 


  This book offers an ideal graduate-level introduction to the theory of partial differential equations. The first part of the book describes the basic mathematical problems and structures associated with elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic partial differential equations, and explores the connections between these fundamental types. Aspects of Brownian motion or pattern formation processes are also presented. The second part focuses on existence schemes and develops estimates for solutions of elliptic equations, such as Sobolev space theory, weak and strong solutions, Schauder estimates, and Moser iteration. In particular, the reader will learn the basic techniques underlying current research in elliptic partial differential equations.



This revised and expanded third edition is enhanced with many additional examples that will help motivate the reader. New features include a reorganized and extended chapter on hyperbolic equations, as well as a new chapter on the relations between different types of partial differential equations, including first-order hyperbolic systems, Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations, viscosity solutions for elliptic PDEs, and much more. Also, the new edition contains additional material on systems of elliptic partial differential equations, and it explains in more detail how the Harnack inequality can be used for the regularity of solutions.

## Principles of Musical Acoustics#principles_of_musical_acoustics
### **William M. Hartmann** 


  *Principles of Musical Acoustics* focuses on the basic principles in the science and technology of music. Musical examples and specific musical instruments demonstrate the principles. The book begins with a study of vibrations and waves, in that order. These topics constitute the basic physical properties of sound, one of two pillars supporting the science of musical acoustics. The second pillar is the human element, the physiological and psychological aspects of acoustical science. The perceptual topics include loudness, pitch, tone color, and localization of sound. With these two pillars in place, it is possible to go in a variety of directions. The book treats in turn, the topics of room acoustics, audio both analog and digital, broadcasting, and speech. It ends with chapters on the traditional musical instruments, organized by family.

The mathematical level of this book assumes that the reader is familiar with elementary algebra. Trigonometric functions, logarithms and powers also appear in the book, but computational techniques are included as these concepts are introduced, and there is further technical help in appendices.

## Quantum Mechanics#quantum_mechanics
### **K. T. Hecht** 


  Intended for beginning graduate students, this text takes the reader from the familiar coordinate representation of quantum mechanics to the modern algebraic approach, emphsizing symmetry principles throughout. After an introduction of the basic postulates and techniques, the book discusses time-independent perturbation theory, angular momentum, identical particles, scattering theory, and time-dependent perturbation theory. It concludes with several lectures on relativistic quantum mechanics and on many-body theory

## Design and Analysis of Experiments#design_and_analysis_of_experiments
### **Angela Dean, Daniel Voss, Danel Draguljić** 


  This textbook takes a strategic approach to the broad-reaching subject of experimental design by identifying the objectives behind an experiment and teaching practical considerations that govern design and implementation, concepts that serve as the basis for the analytical techniques covered. Rather than a collection of miscellaneous approaches, chapters build on the planning, running, and analyzing of simple experiments in an approach that results from decades of teaching the subject. In most experiments, the procedures can be reproduced by readers, thus giving them a broad exposure to experiments that are simple enough to be followed through their entire course. Outlines of student and published experiments appear throughout the text and as exercises at the end of the chapters. The authors develop the theory of estimable functions and analysis of variance with detail, but at a mathematical level that is simultaneously approachable. Throughout the book, statistical aspects of analysis complement practical aspects of design.
This new, second edition includes* an additional chapter on computer experiments
* additional "Using R” sections at the end of each chapter to illustrate R code and output
* updated output for all SAS programs and use of SAS Proc Mixed
* new material on screening experiments and analysis of mixed models
**Angela Dean, PhD,** is Professor Emeritus of Statistics and a member of the Emeritus Academy at The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.

## Sensory Evaluation of Food#sensory_evaluation_of_food
### **Harry T. Lawless, Hildegarde Heymann** 


  The field of sensory science has grown exponentially since the publication of the first edition of *Sensory Evaluation of Food*. Fifteen years ago, the journal *Food Quality and Preference* was fairly new. Now it holds an eminent position as a venue for research on sensory test methods (among many other topics). Knowledge of the intricate cellular processes in chemoreception, as well as their genetic basis has undergone nothing less than a revolution, culminating in the award of the Nobel Prize to Buck and Axel in 2004 for their discovery of the olfactory receptor gene super family. Advances in statistical methodology have accelerated as well. Sensometrics meetings are now vigorous and well-attended annual events. And yet, some things stay the same. Sensory testing will always involve human participants. But humans are tough measuring instruments to work with. They come with varying degrees of acumen, training, experiences, differing genetic equipment, sensory capabilities, and of course, different preferences. Human foibles and their associated error variance will continue to place a limitation on sensory tests and actionable results.

Although methods continue to evolve, appreciation of the core principles of the field is the key to effective application of sensory test methods. This book has been expanded to reflect the advances in methodologies, theory, and analysis that have transpired in the last 15 years. The chapters are now divided into numbered subsections. This may be of assistance to educators who may wish to assign only certain critical sections to beginning students. In some of the opening sections instructors will find suggestions about which sections are key for fundamental understanding of that topic or method. In many chapters we have gone out on a limb and specified a “recommended procedure.” In cases where there are multiple options for procedure or analysis, we usually chose a simple solution over one that is more complex.

This text attempts to be comprehensive, yet understandable to all students at the university level. All the major sensory test methods are illustrated and discussed, including discrimination, descriptive, and affective tests. Some chapters are devoted to special topics, such as thresholds, time-intensity methods, similarity testing, color, texture, sensory quality control, qualitative research methods, consumer test methods and questionnaires, shelf life testing, an introduction to multivariate statistical techniques, and strategic sensory research. The statistical appendix provides basic instruction in the common statistical analyses for sensory evaluation with worked examples.

**Harry T. Lawless** is Professor of Food Science at Cornell University where he teaches sensory evaluation. He has 35 years of experience in chemosensory research and psychophysics. He spent five years in consumer testing in industry, and serves as a consultant to various food and consumer products companies on sensory test methods.**


**Hildegarde Heymann** is Professor of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California at Davis where she teaches sensory evaluation of wine and sensometrics. She spent nearly 17 years at the University of Missouri as a professor of sensory science.**

## Mathematical Physics#mathematical_physics
### **Sadri Hassani** 


  The goal of this book is to expose the reader to the indispensable role that mathematics---often very abstract---plays in modern physics. Starting with the notion of vector spaces, the first half of the book develops topics as diverse as algebras, classical orthogonal polynomials, Fourier analysis, complex analysis, differential and integral equations, operator theory, and multi-dimensional Green's functions. The second half of the book introduces groups, manifolds, Lie groups and their representations, Clifford algebras and their representations, and fiber bundles and their applications to differential geometry and gauge theories.

This second edition is a substantial revision of the first one with a complete rewriting of many chapters and the addition of new ones, including chapters on algebras, representation of Clifford algebras and spinors, fiber bundles, and gauge theories. The spirit of the first edition, namely the balance between rigor and physical application, has been maintained, as is the abundance of historical notes and worked out examples that demonstrate the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" in modern physics.

Einstein has famously said, "The most incomprehensible thing about nature is that it is comprehensible." What he had in mind was reiterated in another one of his famous quotes concerning the question of how " ... mathematics, being after all a product of human thought, is so admirably appropriate to the objects of reality." It is a question that comes to everyone's mind when encountering the highly abstract mathematics required for a deep understanding of modern physics. It is the experience that Eugene Wigner so profoundly described as "the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences."

## Basic Concepts in Computational Physics#basic_concepts_in_computational_physics
### **Benjamin A. Stickler, Ewald Schachinger** 


  This new edition is a concise introduction to the basic methods of computational physics. Readers will discover the benefits of numerical methods for solving complex mathematical problems and for the direct simulation of physical processes.


The book is divided into two main parts: Deterministic methods and stochastic methods in computational physics. Based on concrete problems, the first part discusses numerical differentiation and integration, as well as the treatment of ordinary differential equations. This is extended by a brief introduction to the numerics of partial differential equations. The second part deals with the generation of random numbers, summarizes the basics of stochastics, and subsequently introduces Monte-Carlo (MC) methods. Specific emphasis is on MARKOV chain MC algorithms. The final two chapters discuss data analysis and stochastic optimization. All this is again motivated and augmented by applications from physics. In addition, the book offers a number of appendices to provide the reader with information on topics not discussed in the main text.


Numerous problems with worked-out solutions, chapter introductions and summaries, together with a clear and application-oriented style support the reader. Ready to use C++ codes are provided online.

## Applied Partial Differential Equations#applied_partial_differential_equations
### **J. David Logan** 


  This text presents the standard material usually covered in a one-semester, undergraduate course on boundary value problems and PDEs. Emphasis is placed on motivation, concepts, methods, and interpretation, rather than on formal theory. The concise treatment of the subject is maintained in this third edition covering all the major ideas: the wave equation, the diffusion equation, the Laplace equation, and the advection equation on bounded and unbounded domains. Methods include eigenfunction expansions, integral transforms, and characteristics. In this third edition, text remains intimately tied to applications in heat transfer, wave motion, biological systems, and a variety other topics in pure and applied science. The text offers flexibility to instructors who, for example, may wish to insert topics from biology or numerical methods at any time in the course.

The exposition is presented in a friendly, easy-to-read, style, with mathematical ideas motivated from physical problems. Many exercises and worked examples have been added to this edition. Prerequisites include calculus and ordinary differential equations. A student who reads this book and works many of the exercises will have a sound knowledge for a second course in partial differential equations or for courses in advanced engineering and science. Two additional chapters include short introductions to applications of PDEs in biology and a new chapter to the computation of solutions. A brief appendix reviews techniques from ordinary differential equations.

**From the reviews of the second edition:**

“This second edition of the short undergraduate text provides a fist course in PDE aimed at students in mathematics, engineering and the sciences. The material is standard … Strong emphasis is put on modeling and applications throughout; the main text is supplied with many examples and exercises.”

—R. Steinbauer, **Monatshefte für Mathematik**, Vol. 150 (4), 2007

“This is a unique book in the sense that it provides a coverage of the main topics of the subject in a concise style which is accessible to science and engineering students. … Reading this book and solving the problems, the students will have a solid base for a course in partial differential equations … .”

—Tibor Krisztin, **Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum**, Vol. 74, 2008

## Probability Theory#probability_theory
### **Alexandr A. Borovkov** 


  Probability theory is an actively developing branch of mathematics. It has applications in many areas of science and technology and forms the basis of mathematical statistics. This self-contained, comprehensive book tackles the principal problems and advanced questions of probability theory and random processes in 22 chapters, presented in a logical order but also suitable for dipping into. They include both classical and more recent results, such as large deviations theory, factorization identities, information theory, stochastic recursive sequences. The book is further distinguished by the inclusion of clear and illustrative proofs of the fundamental results that comprise many methodological improvements aimed at simplifying the arguments and making them more transparent.



The importance of the Russian school in the development of probability theory has long been recognized. This book is the translation of the fifth edition of the highly successful and esteemed Russian textbook. This edition includes a number of new sections, such as a new chapter on large deviation theory for random walks, which are of both theoretical and applied interest. The frequent references to Russian literature throughout this work lend a fresh dimension and makes it an invaluable source of reference for Western researchers and advanced students in probability related subjects.



*Probability Theory* will be of interest to both advanced undergraduate and graduate students studying probability theory and its applications. It can serve as a basis for several one-semester courses on probability theory and random processes as well as self-study.

## Learning Landscape Ecology#learning_landscape_ecology
### **Sarah E. Gergel, Monica G. Turner** 


  This title meets a great demand for training in spatial analysis tools accessible to a wide audience. Landscape ecology continues to grow as an exciting discipline with much to offer for solving pressing and emerging problems in environmental science. Much of the strength of landscape ecology lies in its ability to address challenges over large areas, over spatial and temporal scales at which decision-making often occurs. As the world tackles issues related to sustainability and global change, the need for this broad perspective has only increased. Furthermore, spatial data and spatial analysis (core methods in landscape ecology) are critical for analyzing land-cover changes world-wide. While spatial dynamics have long been fundamental to terrestrial conservation strategies, land management and reserve design, mapping and spatial themes are increasingly recognized as important for ecosystem management in aquatic, coastal and marine systems.
This second edition is purposefully more applied and international in its examples, approaches, perspectives and contributors. It includes new advances in quantifying landscape structure and connectivity (such as graph theory), as well as labs that incorporate the latest scientific understanding of ecosystem services, resilience, social-ecological landscapes, and even seascapes. Of course, as before, the exercises emphasize easy-to-use, widely available software.

## Principles of Astrophysics#principles_of_astrophysics
### **Charles Keeton** 


  This book gives a survey of astrophysics at the advanced undergraduate level. It originates from a two-semester course sequence at Rutgers University that is meant to appeal not only to astrophysics students but also more broadly to physics and engineering students. The organization is driven more by physics than by astronomy; in other words, topics are first developed in physics and then applied to astronomical systems that can be investigated, rather than the other way around.

The first half of the book focuses on gravity. Gravity is the dominant force in many astronomical systems, so a tremendous amount can be learned by studying gravity, motion and mass. The theme in this part of the book, as well as throughout astrophysics, is using motion to investigate mass. The goal of Chapters 2-11 is to develop a progressively richer understanding of gravity as it applies to objects ranging from planets and moons to galaxies and the universe as a whole. The second half uses other aspects of physics to address one of the big questions. While “Why are we here?” lies beyond the realm of physics, a closely related question is within our reach: “How did we get here?” The goal of Chapters 12-21 is to understand the physics behind the remarkable story of how the Universe, Earth and life were formed. This book assumes familiarity with vector calculus and introductory physics (mechanics, electromagnetism, gas physics and atomic physics); however, all of the physics topics are reviewed as they come up (and vital aspects of vector calculus are reviewed in the Appendix).

This volume is aimed at undergraduate students majoring in astrophysics, physics or engineering.

## The Finite Volume Method in Computational Fluid Dynamics#the_finite_volume_method_in_computational_fluid_dynamics
### **F. Moukalled, L. Mangani, M. Darwish** 


  This textbook explores both the theoretical foundation of the Finite Volume Method (FVM) and its applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Readers will discover a thorough explanation of the FVM numerics and algorithms used for the simulation of incompressible and compressible fluid flows, along with a detailed examination of the components needed for the development of a collocated unstructured pressure-based CFD solver. Two particular CFD codes are explored. The first is uFVM, a three-dimensional unstructured pressure-based finite volume academic CFD code, implemented within Matlab. The second is OpenFOAM®, an open source framework used in the development of a range of CFD programs for the simulation of industrial scale flow problems.

With over 220 figures, numerous examples and more than one hundred exercise on FVM numerics, programming, and applications, this textbook is suitable for use in an introductory course on the FVM, in an advanced course on numerics, and as a reference for CFD programmers and researchers.

## A Beginner’s Guide to R#a_beginner’s_guide_to_r
### **Alain F. Zuur, Elena N. Ieno, Erik H. W. G. Meesters** 


  Based on their extensive experience with teaching R and statistics to applied scientists, the authors provide a beginner's guide to R. To avoid the difficulty of teaching R and statistics at the same time, statistical methods are kept to a minimum. The text covers how to download and install R, import and manage data, elementary plotting, an introduction to functions, advanced plotting, and common beginner mistakes. This book contains everything you need to know to get started with R.

"Its biggest advantage is that it aims only to teach R...It organizes R commands very efficiently, with much teaching guidance included. I would describe this book as being handy--it's the kind of book that you want to keep in your jacket pocket or backpack all the time, ready for use, like a Swiss Army knife." (Loveday Conquest, University of Washington)


"Whilst several books focus on learning statistics in R..., the authors of this book fill a gap in the market by focusing on learning R whilst almost completely avoiding any statistical jargon...The fact that the authors have very extensive experience of teaching R to absolute beginners shines throughout." (Mark Mainwaring, Lancaster University)


"Exactly what is needed...This is great, nice work. I love the ecological/biological examples; they will be an enormous help." (Andrew J. Tyne, University of Nebraska-Lincoln)

## Structural Analysis#structural_analysis
### **O. A. Bauchau, J. I. Craig** 


  The authors and their colleagues developed this text over many years, teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in structural analysis courses at the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering of the Georgia Institute of Technology.



The emphasis is on clarity and unity in the presentation of basic structural analysis concepts and methods. The equations of linear elasticity and basic constitutive behaviour of isotropic and composite materials are reviewed. The text focuses on the analysis of practical structural components including bars, beams, and plates. Particular attention is devoted to the analysis of thin-walled beams under bending, shearing, and torsion. Advanced topics such as warping, non-uniform torsion, shear deformations, thermal effect and plastic deformations are addressed. A unified treatment of work and energy principles is provided that naturally leads to an examination of approximate analysis methods including an introduction to matrix and finite element methods.



This teaching tool based on practical situations and thorough methodology should prove valuable to both lecturers and students of structural analysis in engineering worldwide.

## Ceramic Materials#ceramic_materials
### **C. Barry Carter, M. Grant Norton** 


  **"… *Ceramic Materials* is exceptionally comprehensive... [and] will be the standard for information on crystalline ceramics for many years." - Robert H. Doremus**, New York State Science and Technology Foundation Professor of Glass and Ceramics Science, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute**


*Ceramic Materials: Science and Engineering* is an up-to-date treatment of ceramic science, engineering, and applications in a single, integrated text. Building on a foundation of crystal structures, phase equilibria, defects and the mechanical properties of ceramic materials, students are shown how these materials are processed for a broad diversity of applications in today's society. Concepts such as how and why ions move, how ceramics interact with light and magnetic fields, and how they respond to temperature changes are discussed in the context of their applications. References to the art and history of ceramics are included throughout the text. The text concludes with discussions of ceramics in biology and medicine, ceramics as gemstones and the role of ceramics in the interplay between industry and the environment. The text is extensively illustrated and includes references and questions for the student.

## New Introduction to Multiple Time Series Analysis#new_introduction_to_multiple_time_series_analysis
### **Helmut Lütkepohl** 


  This reference work and graduate level textbook considers a wide range of models and methods for analyzing and forecasting multiple time series. The models covered include vector autoregressive, cointegrated,vector autoregressive moving average, multivariate ARCH and periodic processes as well as dynamic simultaneous equations and state space models. Least squares, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods are considered for estimating these models. Different procedures for model selection and model specification are treated and a wide range of tests and criteria for model checking are introduced. Causality analysis, impulse response analysis and innovation accounting are presented as tools for structural analysis. The book is accessible to graduate students in business and economics. In addition, multiple time series courses in other fields such as statistics and engineering may be based on it. Applied researchers involved in analyzing multiple time series may benefit from the book as it provides the background and tools for their tasks. It bridges the gap to the difficult technical literature on the topic.

## Language Across the Curriculum & CLIL in English as an Additional Language (EAL) Contexts#language_across_the_curriculum_clil_in_english_as_an_additional_language_eal_contexts
### **Angel M.Y. Lin** 


  This book will be of interest to a broad readership, regardless of whether they have a background in sociolinguistics, functional linguistics or genre theories. It presents an accessible “meta-language” (i.e. a language for talking about language) that is workable and usable for teachers and researchers from both language and content backgrounds, thus facilitating collaboration across content and language subject panels. Chapters 1 to 3 lay the theoretical foundation of this common meta-language by critically reviewing, systematically presenting and integrating key theoretical resources for teachers and researchers in this field. In turn, Chapters 4 to 7 focus on issues in pedagogy and assessment, and on school-based approaches to LAC and CLIL, drawing on both research studies and the experiences of front-line teachers and school administrators. Chapter 8 provides a critical and reflexive angle on the field by asking difficult questions regarding how LAC and CLIL are often situated in contexts characterized by inequality of access to the linguistic and cultural capitals, where the local languages of the students are usually neglected or viewed unfavourably in relation to the L2 in mainstream society, and where teachers are usually positioned as recipients of knowledge rather than makers of knowledge. In closing, Chapter 9 reviews the state of the art in the field and proposes directions for future inquiry.
"*With the publication of this book, teachers, teacher educators, advanced students and researchers can welcome a user-friendly guide to integrating subject-area content and language skills for English language learners. Based on many years’ practical experience with teachers and courses, Lin provides a sound research-based account of how to use a register and genre approach to issues of teacher development and pedagogical content knowledge, cross-subject collaborations, joint curriculum design, and balanced assessment, illustrated with numerous real-world examples. Particularly to be welcomed are the thoughtful review of the research on different approaches and the candid and critical discussion of how to serve students’ best interests while maintaining an honest intellectual commitment to justice, diversity, and creativity. Highly recommended.*"
Professor Jay Lemke, University of California – San DiegoAuthor of Talking Science: Language, Learning, and Values

## Group Theory Applied to Chemistry#group_theory_applied_to_chemistry
### **Arnout Jozef Ceulemans** 


  Chemists are used to the operational definition of symmetry, which crystallographers introduced long before the advent of quantum mechanics. The ball-and-stick models of molecules naturally exhibit the symmetrical properties of macroscopic objects. However, the practitioner of quantum chemistry and molecular modeling is not concerned with balls and sticks, but with subatomic particles: nuclei and electrons. This textbook introduces the subtle metaphors which relate our macroscopic understanding of symmetry to the molecular world. It gradually explains how bodily rotations and reflections, which leave all inter-particle distances unaltered, affect the study of molecular phenomena that depend only on these internal distances. It helps readers to acquire the skills to make use of the mathematical tools of group theory for whatever chemical problems they are confronted with in the course of their own research.

## Computational Geometry#computational_geometry
### **Mark de Berg, Otfried Cheong, Marc van Kreveld, Mark Overmars** 


  Computational geometry emerged from the ?eld of algorithms design and analysis in the late 1970s. It has grown into a recognized discipline with its own journals, conferences, and a large community of active researchers. The success of the ?eld as a research discipline can on the one hand be explained from the beauty of the problems studied and the solutions obtained, and, on the other hand, by the many application domains—computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), robotics, and others—in which geometric algorithms play a fundamental role. For many geometric problems the early algorithmic solutions were either slow or dif?cult to understand and implement. In recent years a number of new algorithmic techniques have been developed that improved and simpli?ed many of the previous approaches. In this textbook we have tried to make these modern algorithmic solutions accessible to a large audience. The book has been written as a textbook for a course in computational geometry, but it can also be used for self-study. 






 [![Computational Geometry](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Pdflogogt.png)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-77974-2.pdf)
## Evidence-Based Interventions for Children with Challenging Behavior#evidence_based_interventions_for_children_with_challenging_behavior
### **Kathleen Hague Armstrong, Julia A. Ogg, Ashley N. Sundman-Wheat, Audra St. John Walsh** 


  When a child has difficulties eating or sleeping, or throws frequent tantrums, many parents cross their fingers and hope it's a phase to be outgrown soon. But when they persist, challenging behaviors can follow children to school, contributing to academic problems, social difficulties, and further problems in adolescence and adulthood.

The authors of *Evidence-Based Interventions for Children with Challenging Behavior* take a preventive approach in this concise, well-detailed guide. Offering best practices from an extensive Response to Intervention (RTI) evidence base, the book provides guidelines for recognizing the extent of feeding, sleeping, toileting, aggression, and other issues, and supplies successful primary, secondary, and tertiary interventions with rationales. Case examples integrate developmental theories and behavior principles into practice, illustrate how strategies work, and show how to ensure that parents and caregivers can implement them consistently for maximum effect. Progress charts, content questions, and other helpful features make this an invaluable resource for students and professionals alike.

Included in the coverage:

* The prevention model and problem solving.
* Screening techniques.
* Evidence-based practices with children and their caregivers.
* Behavior principles and their application.
* Monitoring progress and evaluating outcomes.
* Plus helpful appendices, resource links, and other learning tools.
*Evidence-Based Interventions for Children with Challenging Behavior* is an essential text for graduate students, scientist-practitioners/professionals, and researchers in child and school psychology; assessment, testing and evaluation; occupational therapy; family; educational psychology; and speech pathology.

## Nanotechnology: Principles and Practices#nanotechnology_principles_and_practices
### **Sulabha K. Kulkarni** 


  Given the rapid advances in the field, this book offers an up-to-date introduction to nanomaterials and nanotechnology. Though condensed into a relatively small volume, it spans the whole range of multidisciplinary topics related to nanotechnology. Starting with the basic concepts of quantum mechanics and solid state physics, it presents both physical and chemical synthetic methods, as well as analytical techniques for studying nanostructures. The size-specific properties of nanomaterials, such as their thermal, mechanical, optical and magnetic characteristics, are discussed in detail. The book goes on to illustrate the various applications of nanomaterials in electronics, optoelectronics, cosmetics, energy, textiles and the medical field, and discusses the environmental impact of these technologies. Many new areas, materials and effects are then introduced, including spintronics, soft lithography, metamaterials, the lotus effect, the Gecko effect, and graphene. The book also explains the functional principles of essential techniques, such as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning near field optical microscopy (SNOM), Raman spectroscopy and photoelectron microscopy. In closing, Chapter 14, ‘Practicals’, provides a helpful guide to setting up and conducting inexpensive nanotechnology experiments in teaching laboratories.

## Entertainment Science#entertainment_science
### **Thorsten Hennig-Thurau, Mark B. Houston** 


  The entertainment industry has long been dominated by legendary screenwriter William Goldman’s “Nobody-Knows-Anything” mantra, which argues that success is the result of managerial intuition and instinct. This book builds the case that combining such intuition with data analytics and rigorous scholarly knowledge provides a source of sustainable competitive advantage – the same recipe for success that is behind the rise of firms such as Netflix and Spotify, but has also fueled Disney’s recent success. Unlocking a large repertoire of scientific studies by business scholars and entertainment economists, the authors identify essential factors, mechanisms, and methods that help a new entertainment product succeed. The book thus offers a timely alternative to “Nobody-Knows” decision-making in the digital era: while coupling a good idea with smart data analytics and entertainment theory cannot guarantee a hit, it systematically and substantially increases the probability of success in the entertainment industry. Entertainment Science is poised to inspire fresh new thinking among managers, students of entertainment, and scholars alike.*Thorsten Hennig-Thurau and Mark B. Houston – two of our finest scholars in the area of entertainment marketing – have produced a definitive research-based compendium that cuts across various branches of the arts to explain the phenomena that provide consumption experiences to capture the hearts and minds of audiences.*

Morris B. Holbrook, W. T. Dillard Professor Emeritus of Marketing, Columbia University

*Entertainment Science is a must-read for everyone working in the entertainment industry today, where the impact of digital and the use of big data can’t be ignored anymore. Hennig-Thurau and Houston are the scientific frontrunners of knowledge that the industry urgently needs.*

Michael Kölmel, media entrepreneur and Honorary Professor of Media Economics at University of Leipzig*Entertainment Science’s winning combination of creativity, theory, and data analytics offers managers in the creative industries and beyond a novel, compelling, and comprehensive approach to support their decision-making. This ground-breaking book marks the dawn of a new Golden Age of fruitful conversation between entertainment scholars, managers, and artists.*

## Advanced Quantum Mechanics#advanced_quantum_mechanics
### **Rainer Dick** 


  In this updated and expanded second edition of a well-received and invaluable textbook, Prof. Dick emphasizes the importance of advanced quantum mechanics for materials science and all experimental techniques which employ photon absorption, emission, or scattering. Important aspects of introductory quantum mechanics are covered in the first seven chapters to make the subject self-contained and accessible for a wide audience. *Advanced Quantum Mechanics, Materials and Photons* can therefore be used for advanced undergraduate courses and introductory graduate courses which are targeted towards students with diverse academic backgrounds from the Natural Sciences or Engineering. To enhance this inclusive aspect of making the subject as accessible as possible Appendices A and B also provide introductions to Lagrangian mechanics and the covariant formulation of electrodynamics.

This second edition includes an additional 62 new problems as well as expanded sections on relativistic quantum fields and applications of quantum electrodynamics. Other special features include an introduction to Lagrangian field theory and an integrated discussion of transition amplitudes with discrete or continuous initial or final states. Once students have acquired an understanding of basic quantum mechanics and classical field theory, canonical field quantization is easy. Furthermore, the integrated discussion of transition amplitudes naturally leads to the notions of tr

ansition probabilities, decay rates, absorption cross sections and scattering cross sections, which are important for all experimental techniques that use photon probes. Quantization is first discussed for the Schrödinger field before the relativistic Maxwell, Klein-Gordon and Dirac fields are quantized. Quantized Schrödinger field theory is not only important for condensed matter physics and materials science, but also provides the easiest avenue to general field quantization and is therefore also useful for students with an interest in nuclear and particle physics. The quantization of the Maxwell field is performed in Coulomb gauge. This is the appropriate and practically most useful quantization procedure in condensed matter physics, chemistry, and materials science because it naturally separates the effects of Coulomb interactions, exchange interactions, and photon scattering. The appendices contain additional material that is usually not found in standard quantum mechanics textbooks, including a completeness proof for Eigen functions of one-dimensional Sturm-Liouville problems, logarithms of matrices, and Green’s functions in different dimensions.

## Understanding Statistics Using R#understanding_statistics_using_r
### **Randall Schumacker, Sara Tomek** 


  This book was written to provide resource materials for teachers to use in their introductory or intermediate statistics class. The chapter content is ordered along the lines of many popular statistics books so it should be easy to supplement the content and exercises with class lecture materials. The book contains R script programs to demonstrate important topics and concepts covered in a statistics course, including probability, random sampling, population distribution types, role of the Central Limit Theorem, creation of sampling distributions for statistics, and more. The chapters contain T/F quizzes to test basic knowledge of the topics covered. In addition, the book chapters contain numerous exercises with answers or solutions to the exercises provided. The chapter exercises reinforce an understanding of the statistical concepts presented in the chapters. An instructor can select any of the supplemental materials to enhance lectures and/or provide additional coverage of concepts and topics in their statistics book.

This book uses the R statistical package which contains an extensive library of functions. The R software is free and easily downloaded and installed. The R programs are run in the R Studio software which is a graphical user interface for Windows. The R Studio software makes accessing R programs, viewing output from the exercises, and graphical displays easier to manage. The first chapter of the book covers the fundamentals of the R statistical package. This includes installation of R and R Studio, accessing R packages and libraries of functions. The chapter also covers how to access manuals and technical documentation, as well as, basic R commands used in the R script programs in the chapters. This chapter is important for the instructor to master so that the software can be installed and the R script programs run. The R software is free so students can also install the software and run the R script programs in the chapters. Teachers and students can run the R software on university computers, at home, or on laptop computers making it more available than many commercial software packages.



"As a professor who teaches research methods and advises master and doctoral students, I am often seeking practical resource materials that students can use in their research. This book provides easy to run R examples that allow students to pick and choose content that is relevant to their research. When students learn that the cost for running R is free, they are especially happy!"



**- Kim Nimon, University of North Texas **



"The authors have done a great job of providing resource materials an instructor can use when teaching a statistics course. Strengths of the book are the inclusion of R code, the addition of more than 60 script programs, and the online exercise materials for students. This book reflects the growing use of the mobile R software program for students who may not always have access to other statistical software packages housed on computers in a campus-based lab."

**- David Walker, Northern Illinois University**

## Electricity and Magnetism#electricity_and_magnetism
### **Teruo Matsushita** 


  The author introduces the concept that superconductivity can establish a perfect formalism of electricity and magnetism. The correspondence of conductors that exhibit perfect electrostatic shielding (***E***=0) in the static condition and superconductors that show perfect diamagnetism (***B***=0) is given to help readers understand the relationship between electricity and magnetism. Another helpful aspect with the introduction of the superconductivity feature perfect diamagnetism is that the correspondence in the development of the expression of magnetic energy and electric energy is clearly shown.

Additionally, the basic mathematical operation and proofs are shown in an appendix, and there is full use of examples and exercises in each chapter with thorough answers.

## Data Mining#data_mining
### **Charu C. Aggarwal** 


  This textbook explores the different aspects of data mining from the fundamentals to the complex data types and their applications, capturing the wide diversity of problem domains for data mining issues. It goes beyond the traditional focus on data mining problems to introduce advanced data types such as text, time series, discrete sequences, spatial data, graph data, and social networks. Until now, no single book has addressed all these topics in a comprehensive and integrated way. The chapters of this book fall into one of three categories:

* Fundamental chapters: Data mining has four main problems, which correspond to clustering, classification, association pattern mining, and outlier analysis. These chapters comprehensively discuss a wide variety of methods for these problems.
* Domain chapters: These chapters discuss the specific methods used for different domains of data such as text data, time-series data, sequence data, graph data, and spatial data.
Application chapters: These chapters study important applications such as stream mining, Web mining, ranking, recommendations, social networks, and privacy preservation. The domain chapters also have an applied flavor. Appropriate for both introductory and advanced data mining courses, Data Mining: The Textbook balances mathematical details and intuition. It contains the necessary mathematical details for professors and researchers, but it is presented in a simple and intuitive style to improve accessibility for students and industrial practitioners (including those with a limited mathematical background). Numerous illustrations, examples, and exercises are included, with an emphasis on semantically interpretable examples.

Praise for Data Mining: The Textbook -

“As I read through this book, I have already decided to use it in my classes. This is a book written by an outstanding researcher who has made fundamental contributions to data mining, in a way that is both accessible and up to date. The book is complete with theory and practical use cases.

## Probability Theory#probability_theory
### **Achim Klenke** 


  This second edition of the popular textbook contains a comprehensive course in modern probability theory. Overall, probabilistic concepts play an increasingly important role in mathematics, physics, biology, financial engineering and computer science. They help us in understanding magnetism, amorphous media, genetic diversity and the perils of random developments at financial markets, and they guide us in constructing more efficient algorithms.

To address these concepts, the title covers a wide variety of topics, many of which are not usually found in introductory textbooks, such as:

• limit theorems for sums of random variables
• martingales
• percolation
• Markov chains and electrical networks
• construction of stochastic processes
• Poisson point process and infinite divisibility
• large deviation principles and statistical physics
• Brownian motion
• stochastic integral and stochastic differential equations.

The theory is developed rigorously and in a self-contained way, with the chapters on measure theory interlaced with the probabilistic chapters in order to display the power of the abstract concepts in probability theory. This second edition has been carefully extended and includes many new features. It contains updated figures (over 50), computer simulations and some difficult proofs have been made more accessible. A wealth of examples and more than 270 exercises as well as biographic details of key mathematicians support and enliven the presentation. It will be of use to students and researchers in mathematics and statistics in physics, computer science, economics and biology.

## Introduction to Particle and Astroparticle Physics#introduction_to_particle_and_astroparticle_physics
### **Alessandro De Angelis, Mário  Pimenta** 


  This book introduces particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. Starting from an experimental perspective, it provides a unified view of these fields that reflects the very rapid advances being made. This new edition has a number of improvements and has been updated to include material on the Higgs particle and to describe the recently discovered gravitational waves. Astroparticle and particle physics share a common problem: we still don’t have a description of the main ingredients of the Universe from the point of view of its energy budget. Addressing these fascinating issues, and offering a balanced introduction to particle and astroparticle physics that requires only a basic understanding of quantum and classical physics, this book is a valuable resource, particularly for advanced undergraduate students and for those embarking on graduate courses. It includes exercises that offer readers practical insights. It can be used equally well as a self-study book, a reference and a textbook.

## A First Introduction to Quantum Physics#a_first_introduction_to_quantum_physics
### **Pieter Kok** 


  In this undergraduate textbook, the author develops the quantum theory from first principles based on very simple experiments: a photon travelling through beam splitters to detectors, an electron moving through a Stern-Gerlach machine, and an atom emitting radiation. From the physical description of these experiments follows a natural mathematical description in terms of matrices and complex numbers.
The first part of the book examines how experimental facts force us to let go of some deeply held preconceptions and develops this idea into a mathematical description of states, probabilities, observables, and time evolution using physical applications. The second part of the book explores more advanced topics, including the concept of entanglement, the process of decoherence, and extension of the quantum theory to the situation of a particle in a one-dimensional box. Here, the text makes contact with more traditional treatments of quantum mechanics. The remaining chapters delve deeply into the idea of uncertainty relations and explore what the quantum theory says about the nature of reality.
The book is an ideal and accessible introduction to quantum physics, with modern examples and helpful end-of-chapter exercises.

## Digital Business Models#digital_business_models
### **Bernd W. Wirtz** 


  The spread of the Internet into all areas of business activities has put a particular focus on business models. The digitalization of business processes is the driver of changes in company strategies and management practices alike. This textbook provides a structured and conceptual approach, allowing students and other readers to understand the commonalities and specifics of the respective business models.The book begins with an overview of the business model concept in general by presenting the development of business models, analyzing definitions of business models and discussing the significance of the success of business model management. In turn, Chapter 2 offers insights into and explanations of the business model concept and provides the underlying approaches and ideas behind business models. Building on these foundations, Chapter 3 outlines the fundamental aspects of the digital economy.

In the following chapters the book examines various core models in the business to consumer (B2C) context. The chapters follow a 4-C approach that divides the digital B2C businesses into models focusing on content, commerce, context and connection. Each chapter describes one of the four models and provides information on the respective business model types, the value chain, core assets and competencies as well as a case study. Based on the example of Google, Chapter 8 merges these approaches and describes the development of a hybrid digital business model.

Chapter 9 is dedicated to business-to-business (B2B) digital business models. It shows how companies focus on business solutions such as online provision of sourcing, sales, supportive collaboration and broker services. Chapter 10 shares insight into the innovation aspect of digital business models, presenting structures and processes of digital business model innovation. The book is rounded out by a comprehensive case study on Google/Alphabet that combines all aspects of digital business models.

Conceived as a textbook for students in advanced undergraduate courses, the book will also be useful for professionals and practitioners involved in business model innovation, and applied researchers.

## Quantum Mechanics for Pedestrians 2#quantum_mechanics_for_pedestrians_2
### **Jochen Pade** 


  This book, the second in a two-volume set, provides an introduction to the basics of (mainly) non-relativistic quantum mechanics. While the first volume addresses the basic principles, this second volume discusses applications and extensions to more complex problems. In addition to topics dealt with in traditional quantum mechanics texts, such as symmetries or many-body problems, it also treats issues of current interest such as entanglement, Bell’s inequality, decoherence and various aspects of quantum information in detail. Furthermore, questions concerning the basis of quantum mechanics and epistemological issues which are relevant e.g. to the realism debate are discussed explicitly. A chapter on the interpretations of quantum mechanics rounds out the book.

Readers are introduced to the requisite mathematical tools step by step. In the appendix, the most relevant mathematics is compiled in compact form, and more advanced topics such as the Lenz vector, Hardy’s experiment and Shor’s algorithm are treated in more detail. As an essential aid to learning and teaching, 130 exercises are included, most of them with solutions.This revised second edition is expanded by an introduction into some ideas and problems of relativistic quantum mechanics. In this second volume, an overview of quantum field theory is given and basic conceptions of quantum electrodynamics are treated in some detail.

Originally written as a course for students of science education, the book addresses all those science students and others who are looking for a reasonably simple, fresh and modern introduction to the field.

## Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology#extragalactic_astronomy_and_cosmology
### **Peter Schneider** 


  Accounting for the astonishing developments in the field of *Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology*, this second edition has been updated and substantially expanded. Starting with the description of our home galaxy, the Milky Way, this cogently written textbook introduces the reader to the astronomy of galaxies, their structure, active galactic nuclei, evolution and large scale distribution in the Universe. After an extensive and thorough introduction to modern observational and theoretical cosmology, the focus turns to the formation of structures and astronomical objects in the early Universe. The basics of classical astronomy and stellar astrophysics needed for extragalactic astronomy are provided in the appendix.


The new edition incorporates some of the most spectacular results from new observatories like the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, Herschel, ALMA, WMAP and Planck, as well as new instruments and multi-wavelength campaigns which have expanded our understanding of the Universe and the objects populating it. This includes new views on the galaxy population in the nearby Universe, on elliptical galaxies, as well as a deeper view of the distant Universe approaching the dark ages, and an unprecedented view of the distant dusty Universe. Schneider also discusses the impressive support for the standard model of the Universe, which has been substantially strengthened by recent results, including baryon acoustic oscillations (an approach which has significantly matured over the years), results from the completed WMAP mission and from the first Planck results, which have confirmed and greatly improved on these findings, not least by measuring the gravitational lensing effect on the microwave background. Further, a new chapter focusing on galaxy evolution illustrates how well the observations of distant galaxies and their central supermassive black holes can be understood in a general framework of theoretical ideas, models, and numerical simulations.

Peter Schneider’s *Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology* offers fundamental information on this fascinating subfield of astronomy, while leading readers to the forefront of astronomical research. But it seeks to accomplish this not only with extensive textual information and insights; the author’s own passion for exploring the workings of the Universe, which can be seen in the text and the many supporting color illustrations, will further inspire the reader.
While this book has grown out of introductory university courses on astronomy and astrophysics and includes a set of problems and solutions, it will not only benefit undergraduate students and lecturers; thanks to the comprehensive coverage of the field, even graduate students and researchers specializing in related fields will appreciate it as a valuable reference work.

## Cosmology for the Curious#cosmology_for_the_curious
### **Delia Perlov, Alex Vilenkin** 


  This book is an introductory text for all those wishing to learn about modern views of the cosmos. Our universe originated in a great explosion – the big bang. For nearly a century cosmologists have studied the aftermath of this explosion: how the universe expanded and cooled down, and how galaxies were gradually assembled by gravity. The nature of the bang itself has come into focus only relatively recently. It is the subject of the theory of cosmic inflation, which was developed in the last few decades and has led to a radically new global view of the universe.

Students and other interested readers will find here a non-technical but conceptually rigorous account of modern cosmological ideas - describing what we know, and how we know it. One of the book's central themes is the scientific quest to find answers to the ultimate cosmic questions: Is the universe finite or infinite? Has it existed forever? If not, when and how did it come into being? Will it ever end?  The book is based on the undergraduate course taught by Alex Vilenkin at Tufts University. It assumes no prior knowledge of physics or mathematics beyond elementary high school math. The necessary physics background is introduced as it is required. Each chapter includes a list of questions and exercises of varying degree of difficulty.

## Of Cigarettes, High Heels, and Other Interesting Things#of_cigarettes_high_heels_and_other_interesting_things
### **Marcel Danesi** 


  This book deals with one the most interesting aspects of human life—the search for meaning. It discusses how the science of semiotics is equipped to provide insight on what meaning is and how we produce it. Why is it that certain people routinely put their survival at risk by smoking? Why is it that some women make locomotion difficult for themselves by donning high-heel footwear? Are there unconscious forces at work* *behind such strange behaviors? This book will attempt to answer such questions by claiming that these behaviors are meaningful in culture-specific ways. The discipline that studies such behaviors and their relation to meanings is called *semiotics. *Semiotics probes the human condition in its own peculiar way, by unraveling the meanings of *signs*, which motivate not only the wearing of high heel shoes, but also the construction of words and art forms. Now in its third edition, this landmark introduction to semiotics has been updated with a wealth of new content, focusing on the many developments in digital culture since the previous edition. With the addition of topics such as memes, Selfies, social media profiles, and even Mafia discourse, the new edition comprehensively covers new trends in culture while streamlining treatments of basic semiotics contents. **Marcel Danesi** is Professor of Semiotics and Anthropology at the University of Toronto, Canada. He is renowned for his work in several areas of semiotic study, including pop culture and metaphor. He has been a guest on several broadcast outlets, including National Public Radio. Among his major recent publications are* The History of the Kiss* (2013) and *Murder in Plain English*,* *with Michael Arntfield (2016). His work has been featured in the *New York Times*, *Toronto Star*, and *Psychology Today*, among other print publications. He is currently Editor-in-Chief of *Semiotica*, the leading journal in semiotics.

## International Handbook of Historical Archaeology#international_handbook_of_historical_archaeology
### **David  Gaimster, Teresita Majewski** 


  In studying the past, archaeologists have focused on the material remains of our predecessors. Prehistorians generally rely almost exclusively on the diverse material record for their understanding of past societies and their behavior. Those involved in studying historically documented cultures not only have extensive material remains but also contemporary texts, images, and a range of investigative methods to enable them to build a broader and more reflexive picture of how past societies, communities, and individuals operated and behaved. Increasingly, historical archaeology refers not to a particular period, place, or a method, but rather to an approach that interrogates the tensions between artifacts and texts irrespective of context. In short, historical archaeology provides direct evidence for how humans have shaped the world we live in today. The 35 essays in the *International Handbook of Historical Archaeology* have been specially commissioned from leading researchers in their fields, creating a wide-ranging digest of the increasingly global field of historical archaeology that will be an essential addition to any library. Authors include both senior and junior scholars and represent the major sectors where historical archaeologists are employed today—the cultural resource/heritage management industry, universities, government agencies, and museums. The volume is divided into two sections, the first reviewing the key themes, issues, and approaches of historical archaeology today, and the second containing a series of case studies charting the development and current state of historical archaeological practice around the world. The contributions to the handbook include unique topical and regional syntheses not found in historical archaeological compendia published to date. This key reference work captures the energy and diversity of this global discipline today, and its format and content are particularly suitable for classroom use.

## Cardiovascular Biomechanics#cardiovascular_biomechanics
### **Peter R. Hoskins, Patricia V. Lawford, Barry J. Doyle** 


  This book provides a balanced presentation of the fundamental principles of cardiovascular biomechanics research, as well as its valuable clinical applications. Pursuing an integrated approach at the interface of the life sciences, physics and engineering, it also includes extensive images to explain the concepts discussed.

Cardiovascular biomechanics encompasses the relationship between the mechanics of the cardiovascular system and biological function in health and disease, and it is increasingly recognised that normal function and diseases involve a complex interplay between biology and mechanical forces. With a focus on explaining the underlying principles, this book examines the physiology and mechanics of circulation, mechanobiology and the biomechanics of different components of the cardiovascular system, in-vivo techniques, in-vitro techniques, and the medical applications of this research.

Written for undergraduate and postgraduate students and including sample problems at the end of each chapter, this interdisciplinary text provides an essential introduction to the topic. It is also an ideal reference text for researchers and clinical practitioners, and will benefit a wide range of students and researchers including engineers, physicists, biologists and clinicians who are interested in the area of cardiovascular biomechanics.

## Polymer Synthesis: Theory and Practice#polymer_synthesis_theory_and_practice
### **Dietrich Braun, Harald Cherdron, Matthias Rehahn, Helmut Ritter, Brigitte Voit** 


  Emphasis is on a broad description of the general methods and processes for the synthesis, modification and characterization of macromolecules. These more fundamental chapters will be supplemented by selected and detailed experiments. In addition to the preparative aspects the book also gives the reader an impression on the relation of chemical constitution and morphology of Polymers to their properties, as well as on their application areas. Thus, an additional textbook will not be needed in order to understand the experiments.

The 5th edition contains numerous changes: In recent years, so-called functional polymers which have special electrical, electronic, optical and biological properties, have gained more and more in interest. This textbook was therefore supplemented by recipes which describe the synthesis of these materials in a new chapter "Functional polymers". Together with new experiments in chapter 3,4 and 5 the book now contains more than 120 recipes that describe a wide range of macromolecules.

## Structural Dynamics#structural_dynamics
### **Mario Paz, Young Hoon Kim** 


  The sixth edition of Structural Dynamics: Theory and Computation is the complete and comprehensive text in the field. It presents modern methods of analysis and techniques adaptable to computer programming clearly and easily. The book is ideal as a text for advanced undergraduates or graduate students taking a first course in structural dynamics. It is arranged in such a way that it can be used for a one- or two-semester course, or span the undergraduate and graduate levels. In addition, this text will serve the practicing engineer as a primary reference.
The text differs from the standard approach of other presentations in which topics are ordered by their mathematical complexity. This text is organized by the type of structural modeling. The author simplifies the subject by presenting a single degree-of-freedom system in the first chapters, then moves to systems with many degrees-of-freedom in the following chapters. Finally, the text moves to applications of the first chapters and special topics in structural dynamics.
This revised textbook intends to provide enhanced learning materials for students to learn structural dynamics, ranging from basics to advanced topics, including their application. When a line-by-line programming language is included with solved problems, students can learn course materials easily and visualize the solved problems using a program. Among several programming languages, MATLAB® has been adopted by many academic institutions across several disciplines. Many educators and students in the U.S. and many international institutions can readily access MATLAB®, which has an appropriate programming language to solve and simulate problems in the textbook. It effectively allows matrix manipulations and plotting of data. Therefore, multi-degree-of freedom problems can be solved in conjunction with the finite element method using MATLAB®.The revised version will include:

· solved 34 examples in Chapters 1 through 22 along with MALAB codes.

· basics of earthquake design with current design codes (ASCE 7-16 and IBC 2018).

· additional figures obtained from MATLAB codes to illustrate time-variant structural behavior and dynamic characteristics (e.g., time versus displacement and spectral chart).

This text is essential for civil engineering students. Professional civil engineers will find it an ideal reference.

## Probability#probability
### **Jim Pitman** 


  This is a text for a one-quarter or one-semester course in probability, aimed at students who have done a year of calculus. The book is organised so a student can learn the fundamental ideas of probability from the first three chapters without reliance on calculus. Later chapters develop these ideas further using calculus tools. The book contains more than the usual number of examples worked out in detail.
The most valuable thing for students to learn from a course like this is how to pick up a probability problem in a new setting and relate it to the standard body of theory. The more they see this happen in class, and the more they do it themselves in exercises, the better. The style of the text is deliberately informal. My experience is that students learn more from intuitive explanations, diagrams, and examples than they do from theorems and proofs. So the emphasis is on problem solving rather than theory.

## Reading, Writing, and Proving#reading_writing_and_proving
### **Ulrich Daepp, Pamela Gorkin** 


  *Reading, Writing, and Proving* is designed to guide mathematics students during their transition from algorithm-based courses such as calculus, to theorem and proof-based courses. This text not only introduces the various proof techniques and other foundational principles of higher mathematics in great detail, but also assists and inspires students to develop the necessary abilities to read, write, and prove using mathematical definitions, examples, and theorems that are required for success in navigating advanced mathematics courses.

In addition to an introduction to mathematical logic, set theory, and the various methods of proof, this textbook prepares students for future courses by providing a strong foundation in the fields of number theory, abstract algebra, and analysis. Also included are a wide variety of examples and exercises as well as a rich selection of unique projects that provide students with an opportunity to investigate a topic independently or as part of a collaborative effort.

New features of the Second Edition include the addition of formal statements of definitions at the end of each chapter; a new chapter featuring the Cantor–Schröder–Bernstein theorem with a spotlight on the continuum hypothesis; over 200 new problems; two new student projects; and more. An electronic solutions manual to selected problems is available online.

From the reviews of the First Edition:

“The book…emphasizes Pòlya’s four-part framework for problem solving (from his book How to Solve It)…[it] contains more than enough material for a one-semester course, and is designed to give the instructor wide leeway in choosing topics to emphasize…This book has a rich selection of problems for the student to ponder, in addition to "exercises" that come with hints or complete solutions…I was charmed by this book and found it quite enticing.”

– Marcia G. Fung for *MAA Reviews*

“… A book worthy of serious consideration for courses whose goal is to prepare students for upper-division mathematics courses. Summing Up: Highly recommended.”

– J. R. Burke, Gonzaga University for *CHOICE Reviews*

  This clearly structured and easy to read textbook explains the concepts and techniques required to write programs that can handle large amounts of data efficiently.

Project-oriented and classroom-tested, the book presents a number of important algorithms supported by motivating examples that bring meaning to the problems faced by computer programmers. The idea of computational complexity is also introduced, demonstrating what can and cannot be computed efficiently so that the programmer can make informed judgements about the algorithms they use. The text assumes some basic experience in computer programming and familiarity in an object-oriented language, but not necessarily with Python.

**Topics and features:**

* Includes both introductory and advanced data structures and algorithms topics, with suggested chapter sequences for those respective courses provided in the preface
* Provides learning goals, review questions and programming exercises in each chapter, as well as numerous illustrative examples
* Offers downloadable programs and supplementary files at an associated website, with instructor materials available from the author
* Presents a primer on Python for those coming from a different language background
* Reviews the use of hashing in sets and maps, along with an examination of binary search trees and tree traversals, and material on depth first search of graphs
* Discusses topics suitable for an advanced course, such as membership structures, heaps, balanced binary search trees, B-trees and heuristic search
Students of computer science will find this clear and concise textbook to be invaluable for undergraduate courses on data structures and algorithms, at both introductory and advanced levels. The book is also suitable as a refresher guide for computer programmers starting new jobs working with Python.

## School Leadership and Educational Change in Singapore#school_leadership_and_educational_change_in_singapore
### **Benjamin Wong, Salleh Hairon, Pak Tee Ng** 


  This book provides readers with insights into how Singapore school leaders are actively engaged in the transformation of the Singapore education system. It brings to attention crucial elucidations of the increasing demand and complexity placed on school leaders through the use of case studies. Each chapter in the book focuses on a particular issue which has become important or has gained renewed importance in the Singapore education system.

The chapters first provide a background to the theme under examination and a theoretical basis for discussion. They then narrate the case that shows how school leaders interpret and implement policy initiatives in their respective schools or lead change in that area. The case studies span over a wide range of domains such as instructional leadership, assessment leadership, stakeholder engagement, professional learning communities, and school branding. The data collected from these case studies came primarily from interviews of educators in their respective school contexts, in addition to other sources of data such as artifacts. Each case study highlights descriptions, interpretations, and perspectives across school contexts, which is consistent with the proposition that school leadership is very much shaped by context. At the end of each chapter, there are guiding questions to help readers critically analyse and reflect on the main learning points of the case.

## UML @ Classroom#uml_classroom
### **Martina Seidl, Marion Scholz, Christian Huemer, Gerti Kappel** 


  This textbook mainly addresses beginners and readers with a basic knowledge of object-oriented programming languages like Java or C#, but with little or no modeling or software engineering experience – thus reflecting the majority of students in introductory courses at universities. Using UML, it introduces basic modeling concepts in a highly precise manner, while refraining from the interpretation of rare special cases.

After a brief explanation of why modeling is an indispensable part of software development, the authors introduce the individual diagram types of UML (the class and object diagram, the sequence diagram, the state machine diagram, the activity diagram, and the use case diagram), as well as their interrelationships, in a step-by-step manner. The topics covered include not only the syntax and the semantics of the individual language elements, but also pragmatic aspects, i.e., how to use them wisely at various stages in the software development process. To this end, the work is complemented with examples that were carefully selected for their educational and illustrative value.

Overall, the book provides a solid foundation and deeper understanding of the most important object-oriented modeling concepts and their application in software development. An additional website offers a complete set of slides to aid in teaching the contents of the book, exercises and further e-learning material.

## Psychology, Religion, and Spirituality#psychology_religion_and_spirituality
### **James M. Nelson** 


  The past century has seen the relationship between psychology and religion progress from wary antagonists to strange bedfellows to complementary worldviews. *Psychology, Religion, and Spirituality* is designed as a text that reflects this history while illuminating the robust dialogue that continues to accompany it.

The elegant, accessible coverage ranges from early psychological critiques of religion and responses from major religious thinkers to positivist and constructivist philosophies; from Jung’s archetypes to neurobiological research into the religious brain; from scientific constructs of prayer, meditation, and mindfulness to collaborative interventions for mental health. The book’s distinctive teaching/learning presentation:



* Discusses non-Western religious traditions in addition to Christianity.


* Balances theoretical literature with empirical research on each topic.


* Reviews contemporary research and debates in psychology and religion.


* Examines developmental approaches to religious and spiritual growth.


* Provides a variety of practical applications.


* Includes review questions, exercises, and other student materials.


* Encourages readers to develop their own ideas on this subject
These are valuable perspectives for graduate or undergraduate courses in the psychology of religion, and a rich resource for graduate courses in psychology and counseling. In addition, *Psychology, Religion, and Spirituality* makes an inviting text for seminary courses in spiritual and pastoral counseling.

## Fatigue of Structures and Materials#fatigue_of_structures_and_materials
### **Jaap Schijve** 


  This book is primarily a textbook written for people working on fatigue problems of engineering structures and materials associated with design, predictions, load spectra and experimental verifications. Many different fields of interest are involved, as the block diagram on the front cover indicates. It is of great importance that all these aspects are well recognized and understood. The author explains the various topics in a number of chapters. Understanding of the fatigue phenomena covering both crack initiation and crack growth is emphasized in view of possible influences of design variables, material selection, production technology and load spectra on the fatigue performance of a structure. Prediction methods for fatigue lives and fatigue crack growth are discussed as well as verification by experiments. Load spectra analysis and statistical aspects are also addressed.
The first edition of this book was well received and has been used extensively in various courses taught to staff members and students of universities and other technical colleges as well as in industries and at research institutes. Therefore it was considered time for a second edition. In general, the format of the first edition of the book has been maintained, but the whole text has been carefully revised.

## Alternative Energy Sources#alternative_energy_sources
### **Efstathios E. (Stathis) Michaelides** 


  *Alternative Energy Sources* is designed to give the reader, a clear view of the role each form of alternative energy may play in supplying the energy needs of the human society in the near and intermediate future (20-50 years).



The two first chapters on *energy demand and supply* and *environmental effects,* set the tone as to why the widespread use of alternative energy is essential for the future of human society. The third chapter exposes the reader to the laws of energy conversion processes, as well as the limitations of converting one energy form to another. The sections on *exergy* give a succinct, quantitative background on the capability/potential of each energy source to produce power on a global scale. The fourth, fifth and sixth chapters are expositions of *fission and fusion nuclear energy*. The following five chapters (seventh to eleventh) include detailed descriptions of the most common renewable energy sources – *wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, hydroelectric* – and some of the less common sources, such as *tidal* and *wave* energy. The emphasis of these chapters is on the global potential of each source; the engineering/technical systems that are currently used in harnessing the potential of each one of these energy sources; the technological developments that will contribute to wider utilization of the sources; and the environmental effects associated with their current and their wider use. The last three chapters are: *energy storage*, which is the main limitation of the wider use of solar and wind power and will become an important issue if renewable energy sources are to be used widely; *energy conservation,* which appears to be everyone’s favorite issue, but by itself is not a solution to our *energy challenge; *and *energy economics,* a necessary consideration in market-driven economies.



The fourteen chapters in the book have been chosen so that one may fit a semester University course around this book. At the end of every chapter, there are 12-20 problems including 1-3 thought-provoking questions on a major socio-economic issue related to energy. In instructor may assign essays, discussions, presentations or design a further research project around these problems.

## Policing and Minority Communities#policing_and_minority_communities
### **James F. Albrecht, Garth den Heyer, Perry Stanislas** 


  This insightful book examines the allegations against the professionalism, transparency, and integrity of law enforcement toward minority groups, from a global perspective. It addresses the challenges inherent in maintaining strong ties with members of the community, and draws attention to obstacles in ensuring public confidence and trust in rule of law institutions. Most importantly, the book provides insight into mechanisms and proposals for policy reform that would permit enhanced police-community partnership, collaboration and mutual respect.
Acknowledging the consistency of this concern despite geographic location, ethnic diversity, and religious tolerance, this book considers controversial factors that have caused many groups and individuals to question their relationship with law enforcement. The book examines the context of police-community relations with contributed research from Nigeria, South Africa, Kosovo, Turkey, New Zealand, Mexico, Scandinavia and other North American and European viewpoints. It evaluates the roles that critical factors such as ethnicity, political instability, conflict, colonization, mental health, police practice, religion, critical criminology, socialism, and many other important aspects and concepts have played on perceptions of policing and rule of law.A valuable resource for law enforcement practitioners and researchers, policy makers, and students of criminal justice,*Policing and Minority Communities: **Contemporary Issues and Global Perspectives *confronts crucial challenges and controversies in policing today with quantitative and qualitative research and practical policy recommendations.

## Calculus With Applications#calculus_with_applications
### **Peter D. Lax, Maria Shea Terrell** 


  This new edition of Lax, Burstein, and Lax's *Calculus with Applications and Computing* offers meaningful explanations of the important theorems of single variable calculus. Written with students in mathematics, the physical sciences, and engineering in mind, and revised with their help, it shows that the themes of calculation, approximation, and modeling are central to mathematics and the main ideas of single variable calculus. This edition brings the innovation of the first edition to a new generation of students. New sections in this book use simple, elementary examples to show that when applying calculus concepts to approximations of functions, uniform convergence is more natural and easier to use than point-wise convergence. As in the original, this edition includes material that is essential for students in science and engineering, including an elementary introduction to complex numbers and complex-valued functions, applications of calculus to modeling vibrations and population dynamics, and an introduction to probability and information theory.

## Clinical Data Analysis on a Pocket Calculator#clinical_data_analysis_on_a_pocket_calculator
### **Ton J. Cleophas, Aeilko H. Zwinderman** 


  In everyone's life the day comes that medical and health care has the highest priority. It is unbelievable, that a field, so important, uses the scientific method so little. The current book is helpful for implementation of the scientific method in the daily life of medical and health care workers. From readers' comments to the first editions of this work, the authors came to realize that statistical software programs is experienced by professionals in the field as black box programs producing lots of p-values, but little answers to scientific questions, and many readers had not been happy with that situation. The pocket calculator analyses appeared to be, particularly, appreciated, because they enabled readers for the first time to understand the scientific methods of statistical reasoning and hypothesis testing. So much so, that it started something like a new dimension in their professional world. We should add a number of statistical methods can be performed more easily on a pocket calculator, than using a software program. Also, there are some specific advantages of the pocket calculator method. You better understand what you are doing. The pocket calculator works faster, because far less steps have to be taken, averages can be used. With statistical software all individual data have to be included separately, a time-consuming activity in case of large data files. Some analytical methods, for example, power calculations and required sample size calculations are difficult on a statistical software program, and easy on a pocket calculator.

The reason for a rewrite was to give updated and upgraded versions of the forty chapters from the first editions, including the valuable comments of readers. Like in the textbook complementary to the current work, entitled "SPSS for Starters and 2nd Levelers" (Springer Heidelberg 2015, from the same authors), an improved structure of the chapters was produced, including background, main purpose, scientific question, schematic overview of data files, and reference sections. In addition, for the analysis of more complex data twenty novel chapters were written. We showed that, also here, a pocket calculator can be very helpful.

For the readers' convenience the chapters have been reclassified according to the most basic difference in data characteristics: continuous outcome data (34 chapters), binary outcome data (26 chapters). Both hypothesized and real data examples are used to explain the sixty pocket calculator methods described. The arithmetic is of a no-more-than high-school level.

## Engineering Mechanics 2#engineering_mechanics_2
### **Dietmar Gross, Werner Hauger, Jörg Schröder, Wolfgang A. Wall, Javier Bonet** 


  Now in its second English edition,* Mechanics of Materials* is the second volume of a three-volume textbook series on Engineering Mechanics. It was written with the intention of presenting to engineering students the basic concepts and principles of mechanics in as simple a form as the subject allows. A second objective of this book is to guide the students in their efforts to solve problems in mechanics in a systematic manner. The simple approach to the theory of mechanics allows for the different educational backgrounds of the students. Another aim of this book is to provide engineering students as well as practising engineers with a basis to help them bridge the gaps between undergraduate studies, advanced courses on mechanics and practical engineering problems.
The book contains numerous examples and their solutions. Emphasis is placed upon student participation in solving the problems. The new edition is fully revised and supplemented by additional examples. The contents of the book correspond to the topics normally covered in courses on basic engineering mechanics at universities and colleges.
Volume 1 deals with Statics and Volume 3 treats Particle Dynamics and Rigid Body Dynamics. Separate books with exercises and well elaborated solutions are available.

## Mapping Global Theatre Histories#mapping_global_theatre_histories
### **Mark Pizzato** 


  This textbook provides a global, chronological mapping of significant areas of theatre, sketched from its deepest history in the evolution of our brain's 'inner theatre' to ancient, medieval, modern, and postmodern developments. It considers prehistoric cave art and built temples, African trance dances, ancient Egyptian and Middle-Eastern ritual dramas, Greek and Roman theatres, Asian dance-dramas and puppetry, medieval European performances, global indigenous rituals, early modern to postmodern Euro-American developments, worldwide postcolonial theatres, and the hyper-theatricality of today's mass and social media. Timelines and numbered paragraphs form an overall outline with distilled details of what students can learn, encouraging further explorations online and in the library. Questions suggest how students might reflect on present parallels, making their own maps of global theatre histories, regarding geo-political theatrics in the media, our performances in everyday life, and the theatres inside our brains.

## Principles of Microeconomics#principles_of_microeconomics
### **Martin Kolmar** 


  This text provides a comprehensive and unique introduction to modern microeconomics. It pursues an integrative approach by putting the main findings of economics into a broader perspective; theories are critically reflected on from a philosophical standpoint and by comparing them to approaches found in the social sciences, while implications for the design of the legal system and business practices are highlighted throughout. In addition, the book presents brief examples and comprehensive case studies to facilitate an understanding of the theories’ real-world implications.
Starting from the question as to why and how societies organize economic activity, the book adopts an institutional perspective to analyze the potential and limitations of different market types with regard to alleviating scarcity and achieving distributive objectives.
It not only covers traditional rational-choice models, but also systematically introduces readers to important findings from behavioral economics and psychology.
A companion workbook is available which features a wide variety of exercises, ranging from basic multiple-choice questions to challenging mathematical problems and case study scenarios.

## Statistical Analysis and Data Display#statistical_analysis_and_data_display
### **Richard M. Heiberger, Burt Holland** 


  This contemporary presentation of statistical methods features


extensive use of graphical displays for exploring data and for

displaying the analysis. The authors demonstrate how to analyze

data—showing code, graphics, and accompanying tabular listings—for

all the methods they cover. They emphasize how to construct and

interpret graphs. They discuss principles of graphical design. They

identify situations where visual impressions from graphs may need

confirmation from traditional tabular results. All chapters have

exercises.




The authors provide and discuss R functions for all the new graphical

display formats. All graphs and tabular output in the book were

constructed using these functions. Complete R scripts for all examples

and figures are provided for readers to use as models for their own

analyses.




This book can serve as a standalone text for statistics majors at the

master’s level and for other quantitatively oriented disciplines at

the doctoral level, and as a reference book for researchers. In-depth

discussions of regression analysis, analysis of variance, and design

of experiments are followed by introductions to analysis of discrete

bivariate data, nonparametrics, logistic regression, and ARIMA time

series modeling. The authors illustrate classical concepts and

techniques with a variety of case studies using both newer graphical

tools and traditional tabular displays.




The Second Edition features graphs that are completely redrawn using

the more powerful graphics infrastructure provided by R's lattice

package. There are new sections in several of the chapters, revised

sections in all chapters and several completely new appendices.




New graphical material includes:

• an expanded chapter on graphics;

• a section on graphing Likert Scale Data to build on the importance of

rating scales in fields from population studies to psychometrics;

• a discussion on design of graphics that will work for readers with

color-deficient vision;

• an expanded discussion on the design of multi-panel graphics;

• expanded and new sections in the discrete bivariate statistics chapter

on the use of mosaic plots for contingency tables including the n×2×2

tables for which the Mantel–Haenszel–Cochran test is appropriate;

• an interactive (using the shiny package) presentation of the graphics

for the normal and t-tables that is introduced early and used in many

chapters.




The new appendices include discussions of R, the HH package

designed for R (the material in the HH package was distributed as a

set of standalone functions with the First Edition of this book), the

R Commander package, the RExcel system, the shiny package, and a

minimal discussion on writing R packages. There is a new appendix on

computational precision illustrating and explaining the FAQ

(Frequently Asked Questions) about the differences between the

familiar real number system and the less-familiar floating point

system used in computers. The probability distributions appendix has

been expanded to include more distributions (all the distributions in

base R) and to include graphs of each. The editing appendix from the

First Edition has been split into four expanded appendices—on working

style, writing style, use of a powerful editor, and use of LaTeX for

document preparation.

## Representation Theory#representation_theory
### **William Fulton, Joe Harris** 


  The primary goal of these lectures is to introduce a beginner to the finite­ dimensional representations of Lie groups and Lie algebras. Since this goal is shared by quite a few other books, we should explain in this Preface how our approach differs, although the potential reader can probably see this better by a quick browse through the book. Representation theory is simple to define: it is the study of the ways in which a given group may act on vector spaces. It is almost certainly unique, however, among such clearly delineated subjects, in the breadth of its interest to mathematicians. This is not surprising: group actions are ubiquitous in 20th century mathematics, and where the object on which a group acts is not a vector space, we have learned to replace it by one that is {e. g. , a cohomology group, tangent space, etc. }. As a consequence, many mathematicians other than specialists in the field {or even those who think they might want to be} come in contact with the subject in various ways. It is for such people that this text is designed. To put it another way, we intend this as a book for beginners to learn from and not as a reference. This idea essentially determines the choice of material covered here. As simple as is the definition of representation theory given above, it fragments considerably when we try to get more specific. 






 [![Representation Theory](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Pdflogogt.png)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4612-0979-9.pdf)
## Spine Surgery#spine_surgery
### **Bernhard Meyer, Michael Rauschmann** 


  This book covers the content of European postgraduate spine surgery courses, using a case-based approach. A step-wise solution to a real clinical problem is described and compared to the best available evidence. A weighted conclusion is provided on how to bridge the gap (if there is one) between standard of care and evidence-based medicine.

*Spine Surgery: A Case-Based Approach* is aimed at postgraduate students of spine surgery (both trainee neurosurgeons and trainee orthopedic surgeons), and may also be of interest to medical students.

 






 [![Spine Surgery](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Pdflogogt.png)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-98875-7.pdf)
## Elementary Mechanics Using Python#elementary_mechanics_using_python
### **Anders Malthe-Sørenssen** 


  This book – specifically developed as a novel textbook on elementary classical mechanics – shows how analytical and numerical methods can be seamlessly integrated to solve physics problems. This approach allows students to solve more advanced and applied problems at an earlier stage and equips them to deal with real-world examples well beyond the typical special cases treated in standard textbooks.

Another advantage of this approach is that students are brought closer to the way physics is actually discovered and applied, as they are introduced right from the start to a more exploratory way of understanding phenomena and of developing their physical concepts.

While not a requirement, it is advantageous for the reader to have some prior knowledge of scientific programming with a scripting-type language. This edition of the book uses Python, and a chapter devoted to the basics of scientific programming with Python is included. A parallel edition using Matlab instead of Python is also available.

Last but not least, each chapter is accompanied by an extensive set of course-tested exercises and solutions.

## Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with VHDL #introduction_to_logic_circuits_logic_design_with_vhdl
### **Brock J. LaMeres** 


  This textbook introduces readers to the fundamental hardware used in modern computers. The only pre-requisite is algebra, so it can be taken by college freshman or sophomore students or even used in Advanced Placement courses in high school. This book presents both the classical approach to digital system design (i.e., pen and paper) in addition to the modern hardware description language (HDL) design approach (computer-based). This textbook enables readers to design digital systems using the modern HDL approach while ensuring they have a solid foundation of knowledge of the underlying hardware and theory of their designs. This book is designed to match the way the material is actually taught in the classroom. Topics are presented in a manner which builds foundational knowledge before moving onto advanced topics. The author has designed the content with learning goals and assessment at its core. Each section addresses a specific learning outcome that the learner should be able to “do” after its completion. The concept checks and exercise problems provide a rich set of assessment tools to measure learner performance on each outcome. This book can be used for either a sequence of two courses consisting of an *introduction to logic circuits* (Chapters 1-7) followed by *logic design *(Chapters 8-13) or a single, accelerated course that uses the early chapters as reference material.

* Written the way the material is taught, enabling a bottom-up approach to learning which culminates with a high-level of learning, with a solid foundation;
* Emphasizes examples from which students can learn: contains a solved example for nearly every section in the book;
* Includes more than 600 exercise problems, as well as concept check questions for each section, tied directly to specific learning outcomes.

## Astronautics#astronautics
### **Ulrich Walter** 


  This introductory text covers all the key concepts, relationships, and ideas behind spaceflight and is the perfect companion for students pursuing courses on or related to astronautics. As a crew member of the STS-55 Space Shuttle mission and a full professor of astronautics at the Technical University of Munich, Ulrich Walter is an acknowledged expert in the field. This book is based on his extensive teaching and work with students, and the text is backed up by numerous examples drawn from his own experience. With its end-of-chapter examples and problems, this work is suitable for graduate level or even undergraduate courses in spaceflight, as well as for professionals working in the space industry. This third edition includes substantial revisions of several sections to extend their coverage. These include both theoretical extensions such as the study of relative motion in near-circular orbits, and more practical matters such as additional details about jet-engine and general rocket performance. New sections address regularized equations of orbital motion and their algebraic solutions and also state vector propagation; two new chapters are devoted to orbit geometry and orbit determination and to thermal radiation physics and modelling.

## Basics of Laser Physics#basics_of_laser_physics
### **Karl F. Renk** 


  This textbook provides an introductory presentation of all types of lasers. It contains a general description of the laser, a theoretical treatment and a characterization of its operation as it deals with gas, solid state, free-electron and semiconductor lasers. This expanded and updated second edition of the book presents a description of the dynamics of free-electron laser oscillation using a model introduced in the first edition that allows a reader to understand basic properties of a free-electron laser and makes the difference to “conventional” lasers. The discussions and the treatment of equations are presented in a way that a reader can immediately follow. The book addresses graduate and undergraduate students in science and engineering, featuring problems with solutions and over 400 illustrations.

## Empathetic Space on Screen#empathetic_space_on_screen
### **Amedeo D'Adamo** 


  In this book we learn that there is a clear but complex relationship between setting and character on screen. Certain settings stand out above others—think of the iconic gooey dripping tunnels that Ripley stumbles through in *Aliens*, Norman’s bird-decorated parlour in *Psycho* or the dark Gotham of certain Batman movies. But what makes these particular settings so powerful and iconic? Amedeo D’Adamo explains why we care about and cry for certain characters, and then focuses on how certain places then become windows onto their emotional lives. Using popular case studies such as *Apocalypse Now, Amelie, Homeland *and *The Secret Garden*, this original and insightful book is the first to really explain what makes some settings so effective, revealing an important but as yet uncovered machinery of empathy in visual narrative space. An invaluable resource for students, academics and indeed young filmmakers designing their very own narratives for space on screen.

## Breast Cancer#breast_cancer
### **Umberto Veronesi, Aron Goldhirsch, Paolo Veronesi, Oreste Davide Gentilini, Maria Cristina Leonardi** 


  This book provides the reader with up-to-date information on important advances in the understanding of breast cancer and innovative approaches to its management. Current and emerging perspectives on genetics, biology, and prevention are first discussed in depth, and individual sections are then devoted to pathology, imaging, oncological surgery, plastic and reconstructive surgery, medical oncology, and radiotherapy. In each case the focus is on the most recent progress and/or state of the art therapies and techniques. Further topics to receive detailed consideration include particular conditions requiring multidisciplinary approaches, the investigation of new drugs and immunological agents, lifestyle and psychological aspects, and biostatistics and informatics. The book will be an excellent reference for practitioners, interns and residents in medical oncology, oncologic surgery, radiotherapy, pathology, and human genetics, researchers, and advanced medical students.

## A Pythagorean Introduction to Number Theory#a_pythagorean_introduction_to_number_theory
### **Ramin Takloo-Bighash** 


  Right triangles are at the heart of this textbook’s vibrant new approach to elementary number theory. Inspired by the familiar Pythagorean theorem, the author invites the reader to ask natural arithmetic questions about right triangles, then proceeds to develop the theory needed to respond. Throughout, students are encouraged to engage with the material by posing questions, working through exercises, using technology, and learning about the broader context in which ideas developed.

Progressing from the fundamentals of number theory through to Gauss sums and quadratic reciprocity, the first part of this text presents an innovative first course in elementary number theory. The advanced topics that follow, such as counting lattice points and the four squares theorem, offer a variety of options for extension, or a higher-level course; the breadth and modularity of the later material is ideal for creating a senior capstone course. Numerous exercises are included throughout, many of which are designed for SageMath.By involving students in the active process of inquiry and investigation, this textbook imbues the foundations of number theory with insights into the lively mathematical process that continues to advance the field today. Experience writing proofs is the only formal prerequisite for the book, while a background in basic real analysis will enrich the reader’s appreciation of the final chapters.

## Introduction to Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion#introduction_to_plasma_physics_and_controlled_fusion
### **Francis F. Chen** 


  The third edition of this classic text presents a complete introduction to plasma physics and controlled fusion, written by one of the pioneering scientists in this expanding field. It offers both a simple and intuitive discussion of the basic concepts of the subject matter and an insight into the challenging problems of current research. This outstanding text offers students a painless introduction to this important field; for teachers, a large collection of problems; and for researchers, a concise review of the fundamentals as well as original treatments of a number of topics never before explained so clearly.

In a wholly lucid manner the second edition covered charged-particle motions, plasmas as fluids, kinetic theory, and nonlinear effects. For the third edition, two new chapters have been added to incorporate discussion of more recent advances in the field. The new chapter 9 on Special Plasmas covers non-neutral plasmas, pure electron plasmas, solid and ultra-cold plasmas, pair-ion plasmas, dusty plasmas, helicon plasmas, atmospheric-pressure plasmas, sheath-bounded plasmas, reconnection and turbulence. Following this, chapter 10 describes Plasma Applications such as magnetic fusion (pinches, mirrors, FRCs, stellarators, tokamaks, spheromaks), plasma accelerators and FELs, ine

rtial fusion, semiconductor etching, and spacecraft propulsion.

This new revised edition remains an essential text for those new to the field and an invaluable reference source for established researchers.

## Plant Anatomy#plant_anatomy
### **Richard Crang, Sheila Lyons-Sobaski, Robert Wise** 


  Intended as a text for upper-division undergraduates, graduate students and as a potential reference, this broad-scoped resource is extensive in its educational appeal by providing a new concept-based organization with end-of-chapter literature references, self-quizzes, and illustration interpretation. The concept-based, pedagogical approach, in contrast to the classic discipline-based approach, was specifically chosen to make the teaching and learning of plant anatomy more accessible for students. In addition, for instructors whose backgrounds may not primarily be plant anatomy, the features noted above are designed to provide sufficient reference material for organization and class presentation. This text is unique in the extensive use of over 1150 high-resolution color micrographs, color diagrams and scanning electron micrographs. Another feature is frequent side-boxes that highlight the relationship of plant anatomy to specialized investigations in plant molecular biology, classical investigations, functional activities, and research in forestry, environmental studies and genetics, as well as other fields.

Each of the 19 richly-illustrated chapters has an abstract, a list of keywords, an introduction, a text body consisting of 10 to 20 concept-based sections, and a list of references and additional readings. At the end of each chapter, the instructor and student will find a section-by-section concept review, concept connections, concept assessment (10 multiple-choice questions), and concept applications. Answers to the assessment material are found in an appendix. An index and a glossary with over 700 defined terms complete the volume.

## Modelling Computing Systems#modelling_computing_systems
### **Faron Moller, Georg Struth** 


  We have all experienced delays and frustrations as a result of the notorious ‘computer glitch.’ However, the more dependent we become on computational systems in our daily lives, the more we must ensure that they are safe, reliable and user-friendly.

This engaging textbook presents the fundamental mathematics and modelling techniques for computing systems in a novel and light-hearted way, which can be easily followed by students at the very beginning of their university education. Key concepts are taught through a large collection of challenging yet fun mathematical games and logical puzzles that require no prior knowledge about computers. The text begins with intuition and examples as a basis from which precise concepts are then developed; demonstrating how, by working within the confines of a precise structured method, the occurrence of errors in the system can be drastically reduced.

**Topics and features:**

* Introduces important concepts from discrete mathematics as the basis of computational thinking, presented in a stimulating and motivating style
* Demonstrates how game theory provides a paradigm for an intuitive understanding of the nature of computation
* Contains more than 400 exercises throughout the text, with detailed solutions to half of these presented at the end of the book, together with numerous theorems, definitions and examples
* Describes an approach to the modelling of computing systems based on state transition systems, exploring the languages and techniques for expressing and reasoning about systems specifications and concurrent implementations
This clearly written and classroom-tested textbook/reference is essential reading for first-year undergraduate modules on discrete mathematics and systems modelling.

## Sustainable Supply Chains#sustainable_supply_chains
### **Yann Bouchery, Charles J. Corbett, Jan C. Fransoo, Tarkan Tan** 


  This book is primarily intended to serve as a research-based textbook on sustainable supply chains for graduate programs in Business, Management, Industrial Engineering, and Industrial Ecology, but it should also be of interest for researchers in the broader sustainable supply chain space, whether from the operations management and industrial engineering side or more from the industrial ecology and life-cycle assessment side.
As firms become progressively more tightly coupled in global supply chains, rather than being large vertically integrated monoliths, risks and opportunities associated with activities upstream or downstream will increasingly impinge upon their own wellbeing. For a firm to thrive, it is increasingly imperative that it be aware of economic, environmental and social dimensions of the entire supply chain it belongs to, and that it proactively monitor and manage those. Finding efficient solutions towards a more sustainable supply chain is increasingly important for managers, but clearly this raise difficult questions, often without clear answers. This book aims to provide insights into these kinds of questions for students and practitioners, based on the latest academic research.
We have noticed a recent surge in the number of courses on “sustainable supply chain management” or related topics, but a relative lack of corresponding teaching materials. While sustainability has been widely studied at the level of company strategy and extensive related pedagogical materials exist, there is still a relative lack of materials on sustainability with a supply chain management perspective.
This book is primarily intended to serve as a research-based textbook on sustainable supply chains for graduate programs in Business, Management, Industrial Engineering, and Industrial Ecology, but it should also be of interest for researchers in the broader sustainable supply chain space, whether from the operations management and industrial engineering side or more from the industrial ecology and life-cycle assessment side.

## Quantum Mechanics for Pedestrians 1#quantum_mechanics_for_pedestrians_1
### **Jochen Pade** 


  This book, the first in a two-volume set, provides an introduction to the fundamentals of (mainly) non-relativistic quantum mechanics. This first volume chiefly focuses on the essential principles, while applications and extensions of the formalism can be found in volume 2. Including but also moving beyond material that is covered in traditional textbooks on quantum mechanics, the book discusses in detail current issues such as interaction-free quantum measurements or neutrino oscillations, as well as fundamental problems and epistemological questions, such as the measurement problem. A chapter on the postulates of quantum mechanics rounds off this first volume.

In order to quickly and clearly present the main principles of quantum mechanics and its mathematical formulation, there is a systematic transition between wave mechanics and algebraic representation in the first few chapters, in which the required mathematical tools are introduced step by step. Moreover, the appendix concisely reviews the most important mathematical tools, allowing readers to largely dispense with supplementary literature. The appendix also explores advanced topics, such as the Quantum-Zeno effect and time-delay experiments. Over 250 exercises, most of them with solutions, help to deepen the reader’s understanding of the topics discussed.

This revised second edition is expanded by an introduction to some ideas and problems of relativistic quantum mechanics. In this first volume, the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations are treated. Fundamentals of other areas are compiled in compact form, i.e., outlines of special relativity, classical field theory and electrodynamics.

The book is chiefly intended for student science teachers and all students of physics, majors and minors alike, who are looking for a reasonably easy and modern introduction to quantum mechanics.

## Physics of Semiconductor Devices#physics_of_semiconductor_devices
### **Massimo Rudan** 


  This book describes the basic physics of semiconductors, including the hierarchy of transport models, and connects the theory with the functioning of actual semiconductor devices. Details are worked out carefully and derived from the basic physics, while keeping the internal coherence of the concepts and explaining various levels of approximation. Examples are based on silicon due to its industrial importance. Several chapters are included that provide the reader with the quantum-mechanical concepts necessary for understanding the transport properties of crystals. The behavior of crystals incorporating a position-dependent impurity distribution is described, and the different hierarchical transport models for semiconductor devices are derived (from the Boltzmann transport equation to the hydrodynamic and drift-diffusion models). The transport models are then applied to a detailed description of the main semiconductor-device architectures (bipolar, MOS). The final chapters are devoted to the description of some basic fabrication steps, and to measuring methods for the semiconductor-device parameters.

## Group Theory#group_theory
### **** 


  Every process in physics is governed by selection rules that are the consequence of symmetry requirements. The beauty and strength of group theory resides in the transformation of many complex symmetry operations into a very simple linear algebra. This concise and class-tested book has been pedagogically tailored over 30 years MIT and 2 years at the University Federal of Minas Gerais (UFMG) in Brazil. The approach centers on the conviction that teaching group theory in close connection with applications helps students to learn, understand and use it for their own needs. For this reason, the theoretical background is confined to the first 4 introductory chapters (6-8 classroom hours). From there, each chapter develops new theory while introducing applications so that the students can best retain new concepts, build on concepts learned the previous week, and see interrelations between topics as presented. Essential problem sets between the chapters also aid the retention of the new material and for the consolidation of material learned in previous chapters. The text and problem sets have proved a useful springboard for the application of the basic material presented here to topics in semiconductor physics, and the physics of carbon-based nanostructures.

## Mathematical Logic#mathematical_logic
### **Roman Kossak** 


  This book, presented in two parts, offers a slow introduction to mathematical logic, and several basic concepts of model theory, such as first-order definability, types, symmetries, and elementary extensions.

Its first part, Logic Sets, and Numbers, shows how mathematical logic is used to develop the number structures of classical mathematics. The exposition does not assume any prerequisites; it is rigorous, but as informal as possible. All necessary concepts are introduced exactly as they would be in a course in mathematical logic; but are accompanied by more extensive introductory remarks and examples to motivate formal developments.

The second part, Relations, Structures, Geometry, introduces several basic concepts of model theory, such as first-order definability, types, symmetries, and elementary extensions, and shows how they are used to study and classify mathematical structures. Although more advanced, this second part is accessible to the reader who is either already familiar with basic mathematical logic, or has carefully read the first part of the book. Classical developments in model theory, including the Compactness Theorem and its uses, are discussed. Other topics include tameness, minimality, and order minimality of structures.

The book can be used as an introduction to model theory, but unlike standard texts, it does not require familiarity with abstract algebra. This book will also be of interest to mathematicians who know the technical aspects of the subject, but are not familiar with its history and philosophical background.

## Business Ethics - A Philosophical and Behavioral Approach#business_ethics_a_philosophical_and_behavioral_approach
### **Christian A. Conrad** 


  This textbook examines the extent to which moral values play a role as productive forces for the economy, and explores the effect of ethical and unethical Behavior on the economy. It shows how ethics improves productivity in the economy, and provides specific ethics tools for practical application for students and managers. Stemming from an overall interdisciplinary approach, and combining recent research results from sciences such as economics, business administration, Behavioral economics, philosophy, psychology and sociology, this textbook fills a gap in the literature on ethics in business.

The book begins with the foundations of business ethics by defining business ethics, delineating its objectives, and discussing the importance of business ethics for business, the economy and society. Next, it presents the ethical evaluation approaches to enable the reader to evaluate economic Behavior ethically. It then explores ‘man in business’, and deals with such issues as Behavior, motivation, ethical orientation, and the presence or absence of a sense of justice. Following this is a discussion of the rules of the market and of questions such as: Does the market economy promote ethical Behavior or is there a conflict of goals between ethics and market economy? Do companies have a social responsibility? The book concludes with an analysis of the importance of ethics for productivity in the enterprise and in the economy, and presents ethics tools as the instruments with which management can promote ethical Behavior of their employees.

Following a textbook structure, the book first derives knowledge from scientific studies that is relevant for students, and then summarizes the results. It explains ethical assessment approaches, and then gives an ethical assessment of economic Behavior using case studies. It uses roleplaying and games to explain the Behavior of people in relation to ethics.

## Machine Learning in Medicine - a Complete Overview#machine_learning_in_medicine_a_complete_overview
### **Ton J. Cleophas, Aeilko H. Zwinderman** 


  The current book is the first publication of a complete overview of machine learning methodologies for the medical and health sector. It was written as a training companion, and as a must-read, not only for physicians and students, but also for any one involved in the process and progress of health and health care. In eighty chapters eighty different machine learning methodologies are reviewed, in combination with data examples for self-assessment. Each chapter can be studied without the need to consult other chapters.

The amount of data stored in the world's databases doubles every 20 months, and clinicians, familiar with traditional statistical methods, are at a loss to analyze them. Traditional methods have, indeed, difficulty to identify outliers in large datasets, and to find patterns in big data and data with multiple exposure / outcome variables. In addition, analysis-rules for surveys and questionnaires, which are currently common methods of data collection, are, essentially, missing. Fortunately, the new discipline, machine learning, is able to cover all of these limitations.

So far medical professionals have been rather reluctant to use machine learning. Also, in the field of diagnosis making, few doctors may want a computer checking them, are interested in collaboration with a computer or with computer engineers. Adequate health and health care will, however, soon be impossible without proper data supervision from modern machine learning methodologies like cluster models, neural networks, and other data mining methodologies.

Each chapter starts with purposes and scientific questions. Then, step-by-step analyses, using data examples, are given. Finally, a paragraph with conclusion, and references to the corresponding sites of three introductory textbooks, previously written by the same authors, is given.** **

## Managing Sustainable Business#managing_sustainable_business
### **Gilbert G. Lenssen, N. Craig Smith** 


  This book offers 32 texts and case studies from across a wide range of business sectors around a managerial framework for Sustainable Business. The case studies are developed for and tested in executive education programmes at leading business schools.

The book is based on the premise that the key for managing the sustainable business is finding the right balance over time between managing competitiveness and profitability AND managing the context of the business with its political, social and ecological risks and opportunities. In that way, a sustainable business is highly responsive to the demands and challenges from both markets and societies and managers embrace the complexity, ambivalence and uncertainty that goes along with this approach.

The book presents a framework that facilitates the adoption of best business practice. This framework leads executives through a systematic approach of strategic analysis and business planning in risk management, issues management, stakeholder management, sustainable business development and strategic differentiation, business model innovation and developing dynamic capabilities.



The approach helps broaden the understanding of what sustainable performance means, by protecting business value against sustainability risks and creating business value from sustainability opportunities.

## Elementary Analysis#elementary_analysis
### **Kenneth A. Ross** 


  For over three decades, this best-selling classic has been used by thousands of students in the United States and abroad as a must-have textbook for a transitional course from calculus to analysis. It has proven to be very useful for mathematics majors who have no previous experience with rigorous proofs. Its friendly style unlocks the mystery of writing proofs, while carefully examining the theoretical basis for calculus. Proofs are given in full, and the large number of well-chosen examples and exercises range from routine to challenging.

The second edition preserves the book’s clear and concise style, illuminating discussions, and simple, well-motivated proofs. New topics include material on the irrationality of pi, the Baire category theorem, Newton's method and the secant method, and continuous nowhere-differentiable functions.

Review from the first edition:

"This book is intended for the student who has a good, but naïve, understanding of elementary calculus and now wishes to gain a thorough understanding of a few basic concepts in analysis.... The author has tried to write in an informal but precise style, stressing motivation and methods of proof, and ... has succeeded admirably."

## Modeling Life#modeling_life
### **Alan Garfinkel, Jane Shevtsov, Yina Guo** 


  From predator-prey populations in an ecosystem, to hormone regulation within the body, the natural world abounds in dynamical systems that affect us profoundly. This book develops the mathematical tools essential for students in the life sciences to describe these interacting systems and to understand and predict their behavior. Complex feedback relations and counter-intuitive responses are common in dynamical systems in nature; this book develops the quantitative skills needed to explore these interactions. Differential equations are the natural mathematical tool for quantifying change, and are the driving force throughout this book. The use of Euler’s method makes nonlinear examples tractable and accessible to a broad spectrum of early-stage undergraduates, thus providing a practical alternative to the procedural approach of a traditional Calculus curriculum. Tools are developed within numerous, relevant examples, with an emphasis on the construction, evaluation, and interpretation of mathematical models throughout. Encountering these concepts in context, students learn not only quantitative techniques, but how to bridge between biological and mathematical ways of thinking. Examples range broadly, exploring the dynamics of neurons and the immune system, through to population dynamics and the Google PageRank algorithm. Each scenario relies only on an interest in the natural world; no biological expertise is assumed of student or instructor. Building on a single prerequisite of Precalculus, the book suits a two-quarter sequence for first or second year undergraduates, and meets the mathematical requirements of medical school entry. The later material provides opportunities for more advanced students in both mathematics and life sciences to revisit theoretical knowledge in a rich, real-world framework. In all cases, the focus is clear: how does the math help us understand the science?

## Introduction to Partial Differential Equations#introduction_to_partial_differential_equations
### **Peter J. Olver** 


  This textbook is designed for a one year course covering the fundamentals of partial differential equations, geared towards advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students in mathematics, science, engineering, and elsewhere. The exposition carefully balances solution techniques, mathematical rigor, and significant applications, all illustrated by numerous examples. Extensive exercise sets appear at the end of almost every subsection, and include straightforward computational problems to develop and reinforce new techniques and results, details on theoretical developments and proofs, challenging projects both computational and conceptual, and supplementary material that motivates the student to delve further into the subject.

No previous experience with the subject of partial differential equations or Fourier theory is assumed, the main prerequisites being undergraduate calculus, both one- and multi-variable, ordinary differential equations, and basic linear algebra. While the classical topics of separation of variables, Fourier analysis, boundary value problems, Green's functions, and special functions continue to form the core of an introductory course, the inclusion of nonlinear equations, shock wave dynamics, symmetry and similarity, the Maximum Principle, financial models, dispersion and solitons, Huygens'

Principle, quantum mechanical systems, and more make this text well attuned to recent developments and trends in this active field of contemporary research. Numerical approximation schemes are an important component of any introductory course, and the text covers the two most basic approaches: finite differences and finite elements.

Peter J. Olver is professor of mathematics at the University of Minnesota. His wide-ranging research interests are centered on the development of symmetry-based methods for differential equations and their manifold applications. He is the author of over 130 papers published in major scientific research journals as well as 4 other books, including the definitive Springer graduate text, Applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations, and another undergraduate text, Applied Linear Algebra.

A Solutions Manual for instrucors is available by clicking on "Selected Solutions Manual" under the Additional Information section on the right-hand side of this page.

## Physics of Oscillations and Waves#physics_of_oscillations_and_waves
### **Arnt Inge Vistnes** 


  In this textbook a combination of standard mathematics and modern numerical methods is used to describe a wide range of natural wave phenomena, such as sound, light and water waves, particularly in specific popular contexts, e.g. colors or the acoustics of musical instruments. It introduces the reader to the basic physical principles that allow the description of the oscillatory motion of matter and classical fields, as well as resulting concepts including interference, diffraction, and coherence. Numerical methods offer new scientific insights and make it possible to handle interesting cases that can’t readily be addressed using analytical mathematics; this holds true not only for problem solving but also for the description of phenomena. Essential physical parameters are brought more into focus, rather than concentrating on the details of which mathematical trick should be used to obtain a certain solution. Readers will learn how time-resolved frequency analysis offers a deeper understanding of the interplay between frequency and time, which is relevant to many phenomena involving oscillations and waves. Attention is also drawn to common misconceptions resulting from uncritical use of the Fourier transform. The book offers an ideal guide for upper-level undergraduate physics students and will also benefit physics instructors. Program codes in Matlab and Python, together with interesting files for use in the problems, are provided as free supplementary material.

## Brewing Science: A Multidisciplinary Approach#brewing_science_a_multidisciplinary_approach
### **Michael Mosher, Kenneth Trantham** 


  This text finally collects all the introductory aspects of beer brewing science into one place for undergraduate brewing science courses. This expansive and detailed work is written in conversational style, walking students through all the brewing basics from the origin and history of beer to the brewing process to post-brew packaging and quality control and assurance. As an introductory text, this book assumes the reader has no prior knowledge of brewing science and only limited experience with chemistry, biology and physics. The text provides students with all the necessary details of brewing science using a multidisciplinary approach, with a thorough and well-defined program of in-chapter and end-of-chapter problems. As students solve these problems, they will learn how scientists think about beer and brewing and develop a critical thinking approach to addressing concerns in brewing science.

As a truly comprehensive introduction to brewing science, *Brewing Science: A Multidisciplinary Approach *walks students through the entire spectrum of the brewing process. The different styles of beer, the molecular makeup and physical parameters, and how those are modified to provide different flavors are listed. All aspects of the brewery process, from the different setup styles to sterility to the presentation of the final product, are outlined in full. All the important brewing steps and techniques are covered in meticulous detail, including malting, mashing, boiling, fermenting and conditioning. Bringing the brewing process full circle, this text covers packaging aspects for the final product as well, focusing on everything from packaging technology to quality control. Students are also pointed to the future, with coverage of emerging flavor profiles, styles and brewing methods.



Each chapter in this textbook includes a sample of related laboratory exercises designed to develop a student’s capability to critically think about brewing science. These exercises assume that the student has limited or no previous experience in the laboratory. The tasks outlined explore key topics in each chapter based on typical analyses that may be performed in the brewery. Such exposure to the laboratory portion of a course of study will significantly aid those students interested in a career in brewing science.

## Witnessing Torture#witnessing_torture
### **Alexandra S. Moore, Elizabeth Swanson** 


  This book demonstrates a new, interdisciplinary approach to life writing about torture that situates torture firmly within its socio-political context, as opposed to extending the long line of representations written in the idiom of the proverbial *dark chamber*. By dismantling the rhetorical divide that typically separates survivors’ suffering from human rights workers’ expertise, contributors engage with the personal, professional, and institutional dimensions of torture and redress. Essays in this volume consider torture from diverse locations – the Philippines, Argentina, Sudan, and Guantánamo, among others. From across the globe, contributors witness both individual pain and institutional complicity; the challenges of building communities of healing across linguistic and national divides; and the role of the law, art, writing, and teaching in representing and responding to torture.

## Robotics, Vision and Control#robotics_vision_and_control
### **Peter Corke** 


  The practice of robotics and computer vision both involve the application of computational algorithms to data. Over the fairly recent history of the fields of robotics and computer vision a very large body of algorithms has been developed. However this body of knowledge is something of a barrier for anybody entering the field, or even looking to see if they want to enter the field — What is the right algorithm for a particular problem?, and importantly, How can I try it out without spending days coding and debugging it from the original research papers?

The author has maintained two open-source MATLAB Toolboxes for more than 10 years: one for robotics and one for vision. The key strength of the Toolboxes provide a set of tools that allow the user to work with real problems, not trivial examples. For the student the book makes the algorithms accessible, the Toolbox code can be read to gain understanding, and the examples illustrate how it can be used —instant gratification in just a couple of lines of MATLAB code. The code can also be the starting point for new work, for researchers or students, by writing programs based on Toolbox functions, or modifying the Toolbox code itself.

The purpose of this book is to expand on the tutorial material provided with the toolboxes, add many more examples, and to weave this into a narrative that covers robotics and computer vision separately and together. The author shows how complex problems can be decomposed and solved using just a few simple lines of code, and hopefully to inspire up and coming researchers. The topics covered are guided by the real problems observed over many years as a practitioner of both robotics and computer vision. It is written in a light but informative style, it is easy to read and absorb, and includes a lot of Matlab examples and figures. The book is a real walk through the fundamentals of robot kinematics, dynamics and joint level control, then camera models, image processing, feature extraction and epipolar geometry, and bring it all together in a visual servo system.

## Criminal Justice and Mental Health#criminal_justice_and_mental_health
### **Jada Hector, David Khey** 


  This textbook provides an overview for students in Criminology and Criminal Justice about the overlap between the criminal justice system and mental health. It provides an accessible overview of basic signs and symptoms of major mental illnesses and size of scope of justice-involved individuals with mental illness.

In the United States, the criminal justice system is often the first public service to be in contact with individuals suffering from mental illness or in mental distress. Those with untreated mental illnesses are often at higher risk for committing criminal acts, yet research on this population continues to shed light on common myths – such a prevailing assumption that those with mental illness tend to commit more violent crimes. Law enforcement agents may be called in as first responders for cases of mental distress; and due to a lack of mental health facilities, resources, and pervasive misconceptions about this population, those with mental illness often end up in the corrections system.

In this environment, students in Criminology and Criminal Justice are likely to encounter those with mental illness in their future career paths, and need to be prepared for this reality. This timely work covers the roles of each part of the criminal justice system interacting with mentally ill individuals, from law enforcement and first responders, social services, public health services, sentencing and corrections, to release and re-entry. It also covers the crucial topic of mental health for criminal justice professionals, who suffer from high rates of job stress, PTSD, and other mental health issues. The final section of the book includes suggestions for future research.

This work will be of interest to students of criminology and criminal justice with an interest in working in the professional sector, as well as those in related fields of sociology, psychology, and public health. It will also be of interest to policy-makers and practitioners already working in the field. The overall goal of this work is to inform, educate, and inspire change.

## Applied Linear Algebra#applied_linear_algebra
### **Peter J. Olver, Chehrzad Shakiban** 


  This textbook develops the essential tools of linear algebra, with the goal of imparting technique alongside contextual understanding. Applications go hand-in-hand with theory, each reinforcing and explaining the other. This approach encourages students to develop not only the technical proficiency needed to go on to further study, but an appreciation for when, why, and how the tools of linear algebra can be used across modern applied mathematics.

Providing an extensive treatment of essential topics such as Gaussian elimination, inner products and norms, and eigenvalues and singular values, this text can be used for an in-depth first course, or an application-driven second course in linear algebra. In this second edition, applications have been updated and expanded to include numerical methods, dynamical systems, data analysis, and signal processing, while the pedagogical flow of the core material has been improved. Throughout, the text emphasizes the conceptual connections between each application and the underlying linear algebraic techniques, thereby enabling students not only to learn how to apply the mathematical tools in routine contexts, but also to understand what is required to adapt to unusual or emerging problems.No previous knowledge of linear algebra is needed to approach this text, with single-variable calculus as the only formal prerequisite. However, the reader will need to draw upon some mathematical maturity to engage in the increasing abstraction inherent to the subject. Once equipped with the main tools and concepts from this book, students will be prepared for further study in differential equations, numerical analysis, data science and statistics, and a broad range of applications. The first author’s text, *Introduction to Partial Differential Equations*, is an ideal companion volume, forming a natural extension of the linear mathematical methods developed here.

## Teaching Medicine and Medical Ethics Using Popular Culture#teaching_medicine_and_medical_ethics_using_popular_culture
### **Evie Kendal, Basia Diug** 


  This book demonstrates how popular culture can be successfully incorporated into medical and health science curriculums, capitalising on the opportunity fictional media presents to humanise case studies. Studies show that the vast majority of medical and nursing students watch popular medical television dramas and comedies such as *Grey’s Anatomy*,* ER*, *House M.D*. and *Scrubs*. This affords us with a unique opportunity to engage and inform not only students but the general public and patients further downstream. This volume analyses examples of medical-themed popular culture and offers various strategies and methods for educators in this field to integrate this material into their teaching. The result is a fascinating read and original resource for medical professionals and teachers alike.

## Readings in Formal Epistemology#readings_in_formal_epistemology
### **Horacio Arló-Costa, Vincent F. Hendricks, Johan van Benthem** 


  This volume presents 38 classic texts in formal epistemology, and strengthens the ties between research into this area of philosophy and its neighbouring intellectual disciplines. The editors provide introductions to five subsections: Bayesian Epistemology, Belief Change, Decision Theory, Interactive Epistemology and Epistemic Logic.

'Formal epistemology' is a term coined in the late 1990s for a new constellation of interests in philosophy, the origins of which are found in earlier works of epistemologists, philosophers of science and logicians. It addresses a growing agenda of problems concerning knowledge, belief, certainty, rationality, deliberation, decision, strategy, action and agent interaction – and it does so using methods from logic, probability, computability, decision and game theory. The volume also includes a thorough index and suggestions for further reading, and thus offers a complete teaching and research package for students as well as research scholars of formal epistemology, philosophy, logic, computer science, theoretical economics and cognitive psychology. ​

## Leadership Today#leadership_today
### **Joan Marques, Satinder Dhiman** 


  This textbook provides a clear understanding of leadership needs in today’s business world, explained within the scope of hard and soft leadership skills. It captures qualities and skills such as spirituality, empathy, moral behavior, mindfulness, empathy, problem solving, self-confidence, ambition, knowledge, global understanding, and information technology. This text explains and provides guidelines for the implementation of each skill and includes examples from contemporary and historical leaders inviting the reader to consider each quality and engage in self-reflection. This book deviates from excessive theoretical descriptions presenting a timely, hands-on approach to leadership.

Even though leadership, as a phenomenon, has been studied extensively in the past decades, it remains a challenge as times, needs, and perceptions change and the world increasingly merges into a global village. Numerous leadership styles have been developed, varying from resonant, servant, and laissez faire, to authentic, authoritative, and coercive; from charismatic and team, to transformational and transactional leadership. And while each leadership style harbors a wealth of qualities, strategies, and behavioral guidelines toward successful implementation, there are critical overarching themes that keep emerging, regardless of the “label” one chooses.

In recent years, an important distinction has been established in leadership qualities: soft and hard skills. Soft skills are reflective in nature, and entail qualities such as empathy, motivation, self-awareness, self-regulation, and social skills. In leadership performance, the application of soft skills entails a combination of interpersonal and social skills. Hard skills are more of a measurable nature. They encompass analytical and technical skills. Both soft and hard skills are important for leaders because they complement one another.

Featuring contributions form academics and professionals from around the world, this text will be of interest to students, researchers, professionals in business and leadership who aspire to lead beyond their immediate environment.

## The Joy of Science#the_joy_of_science
### **Richard A. Lockshin** 


  Scientists have great passion. What could be more exhilarating than to go to work every day feeling as if you were once again a nine-year-old called up to he stage to help the magician with his trick? To be a researcher is to always be in the position of having the chance to see how the trick works. No wonder that many researchers feel that each new day is the most exciting day to be a scientist. It therefore is not surprising that scientists have such trouble communicating with non-scientists. It is difficult for the scientist to understand a life not focused on the desire to understand. But the differences are not that. Everyone wants to understand; that is one of the factors that make us human. The difference is more that scientists limit their definition of comprehension to specific rules of logic and evidence. These rules apply and are used in everyday life, but often with less rigor or restrictions on evidence.

## Clinical Neuroanatomy: A Neurobehavioral Approach#clinical_neuroanatomy_a_neurobehavioral_approach
### **John E. Mendoza, Anne L. Foundas** 


  The collaboration of a clinical neuropsychologist and a behavioral neurologist, *Clinical Neuroanatomy* expands upon similar texts by offering an exceptionally extensive review of higher cortical – behavioral functions and their anatomical substrates. While a major text for students and clinicians in neuropsychology, it is highly relevant for behavioral and traditional neurologists, neuropsychiatrists, and others who have an interest in exploring the mysteries of brain-behavior relationships.

This book begins with a traditional review of the basic internal and external morphology, major nerve and fiber tracts, behavioral correlates, and clinical syndromes associated with spinal cord, brain stem, and cerebellum designed to reacquaint students and practicing clinicians with the functional anatomy of the subtentorial central nervous system. However, as the text was specifically geared to meet the needs of those practitioners whose primary interest is in what might be termed "higher order cognitive-behavioral function," the main focus of the text is on the brain itself. Borrowing heavily from a Lurian tradition, the central chapters reflect an attempt to offer more detailed, integrated, and, at times, theoretical models of cortical systems and their internal organization. Additional chapters highlight vascular anatomy and associated pathology, as well as neurochemical systems and their potential clinical relevance. The authors’ teaching style enlivens the material with clinical examples and welcomed touches of subtle humor.

-Nearly 300 illustrations help identify key structures and pathways, as well as providing clinical and pathological examples

-Text emphasizes the suspected roles of CNS structures in normal behavior and common consequences of lesions affecting these structures.

-Throughout the text, assessment techniques and guidelines are provided to aid in the examination of the various functional systems.

-Separate sections review the basics of bioelectric and neurochemical transmission at the neuronal and synaptic level.

-Tables, footnotes, and an extensive glossary aid the reader in retaining, understanding, and finding points of particular interest.

## A Clinical Guide to the Treatment of the Human Stress Response#a_clinical_guide_to_the_treatment_of_the_human_stress_response
### **George S. Everly, Jr., Jeffrey M. Lating** 


  A Clinical Guide to the Treatment of the Human Stress Response
Third Edition
George S. Everly, Jr., and Jeffrey M. Lating

Praise for the third edition:

“This is a significant update for a significant book. Everly & Lating once again articulate for practitioners how best to read and manage their clients’ stress and develop effective, evidence-based treatment programs for various stress injuries and disorders. It speaks well of practitioners who have this book within eyesight when stress for themselves as well as their clients require effective action.”
Charles R. Figley, Henry Kurszeg, MD, *Chair in Disaster Mental Health, Tulane University, New Orleans*

“To be effective, our understanding of human stress and suffering must be as comprehensive as the people we seek to help are complex. This superb work helps us step back and see the big picture—the complex interactions of mind, brain, personality, body, spirit, and environment—and does so in a wonderfully clear and practical way. The expansions and revisions in this new edition have made this classic even more useful. I enthusiastically recommend it for practitioners, educators, researchers, and students alike.”
Glenn R. Schiraldi, Ph.D., Lt. Col. (USAR, Ret.), *University of Maryland School of Public Health*

Continuing in the tradition of its noted predecessors, the Third Edition of *A Clinical Guide to the **Treatment of the Human Stress Response *brings the physiological and psychological aspects of stress together in a framework for improved understanding and practice. Thoroughly updated chapters, plus new additions on emerging topics such as resilience, provide theoretical and conceptual background to enhance the practical suggestions. A wealth of treatment strategies allows clinicians to find the most accurate interventions for specific client problems. And by focusing on the body’s stress response instead of on the resulting pathologies, the book offers readers guidelines for preventing worsening symptoms and future relapses. The *Guide’s *expert coverage includes:

• Models of the link between stress arousal and illness.
• A system-by-system overview of stress-related disorders.
• Measurement issues in stress and coping.
• Treatment strategies for stress, including cognitive therapy, neurological desensitization, biofeedback, therapeutic breathing, EMDR, and pharmacology.
• Special chapters on spirituality/religion, nutrition, grief/loss, sleep, and crisis intervention.
• A treatment model, a treatment protocol, self-report forms, and more.
• New chapters on the timely topics of “psychological first aid” and fostering “human resilience,” and more.

Students, practitioners, and researchers in the fields of psychology, psychiatry, medicine, nursing, social work, and public health will welcome the Third Edition of *A Clinical Guide to the Treatment of the Human Stress Response *as a timely, accessible reference to an ongoing--and mounting--challenge.

## Philosophical and Mathematical Logic#philosophical_and_mathematical_logic
### **Harrie de Swart** 


  This book was written to serve as an introduction to logic, with in each chapter – if applicable – special emphasis on the interplay between logic and philosophy, mathematics, language and (theoretical) computer science. The reader will not only be provided with an introduction to classical logic, but to philosophical (modal, epistemic, deontic, temporal) and intuitionistic logic as well. The first chapter is an easy to read non-technical Introduction to the topics in the book. The next chapters are consecutively about Propositional Logic, Sets (finite and infinite), Predicate Logic, Arithmetic and Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems, Modal Logic, Philosophy of Language, Intuitionism and Intuitionistic Logic, Applications (Prolog; Relational Databases and SQL; Social Choice Theory, in particular Majority Judgment) and finally, Fallacies and Unfair Discussion Methods. Throughout the text, the author provides some impressions of the historical development of logic: Stoic and Aristotelian logic, logic in the Middle Ages and Frege's Begriffsschrift, together with the works of George Boole (1815-1864) and August De Morgan (1806-1871), the origin of modern logic. Since "if …, then …" can be considered to be the heart of logic, throughout this book much attention is paid to conditionals: material, strict and relevant implication, entailment, counterfactuals and conversational implicature are treated and many references for further reading are given. Each chapter is concluded with answers to the exercises.

## Foundations of Behavioral Health#foundations_of_behavioral_health
### **Bruce Lubotsky Levin, Ardis Hanson** 


  This comprehensive book examines the organization, financing, delivery, and outcomes of behavioral health (i.e., alcohol, drug abuse, and mental health) services from both U.S. and global perspectives. Addressing the need for more integrative and collaborative approaches in public health and behavioral health initiatives, the book covers the fundamental issues in behavioral health, including epidemiology, insurance and financing, health inequities, implementation sciences, lifespan issues, cultural responsiveness, and policy.
Featuring insightful research from scholars in an interdisciplinary range of academic and professional fields, chapters fall into three distinct sections:

1. **Overview: **Outlines the defining characteristics of behavioral health services and identifies significant challenges in the field

2. **At-Risk Populations:** Explores critical issues for at-risk populations in need of behavioral health services, including children in school environments, youth in juvenile justice systems, and persons with developmental disabilities, among others

3. **Services Delivery:** Presents a rationale for greater integration of health and behavioral health services, and contextualizes this explanation within global trends in behavioral health policy, systems, and services

An in-depth textbook for graduate students studying public health, behavioral health, social work policy, and medical sociology, as well as a useful reference for behavioral health professionals and policy makers, *Foundations of Behavioral Health* provides a global perspective for practice and policy in behavioral health. It promotes better understanding of the importance of integrating population health and behavioral health services, with an eye towards improving and sustaining public health and behavioral health from national, regional, and global perspectives.

## Bayesian and Frequentist Regression Methods#bayesian_and_frequentist_regression_methods
### **Jon Wakefield** 


  *Bayesian and Frequentist Regression Methods* provides a modern account of both Bayesian and frequentist methods of regression analysis. Many texts cover one or the other of the approaches, but this is the most comprehensive combination of Bayesian and frequentist methods that exists in one place. The two philosophical approaches to regression methodology are featured here as complementary techniques, with theory and data analysis providing supplementary components of the discussion. In particular, methods are illustrated using a variety of data sets. The majority of the data sets are drawn from biostatistics but the techniques are generalizable to a wide range of other disciplines. While the philosophy behind each approach is discussed, the book is not ideological in nature and an emphasis is placed on practical application. It is shown that, in many situations, careful application of the respective approaches can lead to broadly similar conclusions. To use this text, the reader requires a basic understanding of calculus and linear algebra, and introductory courses in probability and statistical theory. The book is based on the author's experience teaching a graduate sequence in regression methods. The book website contains all of the code to reproduce all of the analyses and figures contained in the book.

## Robotics, Vision and Control#robotics_vision_and_control
### **Peter Corke** 


  Robotic vision, the combination of robotics and computer vision, involves the application of computer algorithms to data acquired from sensors. The research community has developed a large body of such algorithms but for a newcomer to the field this can be quite daunting. For over 20 years the author has maintained two open-source MATLAB® Toolboxes, one for robotics and one for vision. They provide implementations of many important algorithms and allow users to work with real problems, not just trivial examples. This book makes the fundamental algorithms of robotics, vision and control accessible to all. It weaves together theory, algorithms and examples in a narrative that covers robotics and computer vision separately and together. Using the latest versions of the Toolboxes the author shows how complex problems can be decomposed and solved using just a few simple lines of code. The topics covered are guided by real problems observed by the author over many years as a practitioner of both robotics and computer vision. It is written in an accessible but informative style, easy to read and absorb, and includes over 1000 MATLAB and Simulink® examples and over 400 figures. The book is a real walk through the fundamentals of mobile robots, arm robots. then camera models, image processing, feature extraction and multi-view geometry and finally bringing it all together with an extensive discussion of visual servo systems. This second edition is completely revised, updated and extended with coverage of Lie groups, matrix exponentials and twists; inertial navigation; differential drive robots; lattice planners; pose-graph SLAM and map making; restructured material on arm-robot kinematics and dynamics; series-elastic actuators and operational-space control; Lab color spaces; light field cameras; structured light, bundle adjustment and visual odometry; and photometric visual servoing.



“An authoritative book, reaching across fields, thoughtfully conceived and brilliantly accomplished!”

## Electrical Machines#electrical_machines
### **Slobodan N. Vukosavic** 


  *Electrical Machines *primarily covers the basic functionality and the role of electrical machines in their typical applications. The effort of applying coordinate transforms is justified by obtaining a more intuitive, concise and easy-to-use model.

In this textbook, mathematics is reduced to a necessary minimum, and priority is given to bringing up the system view and explaining the use and external characteristics of machines on their electrical and mechanical ports. Covering the most relevant concepts related to machine size, torque and power, the author explains the losses and secondary effects, outlining cases and conditions in which some secondary phenomena are neglected.

While the goal of developing and using machine mathematical models, equivalent circuits and mechanical characteristics persists through the book, the focus is kept on physical insight of electromechanical conversion process. Details such as the slot shape and the disposition of permanent magnets and their effects on the machine parameters and performance are also covered.


This textbook is intended for undergraduate students of electrical engineering as their first course in electrical machines. It is also recommended for students preparing capstone projects in which they need to understand, model, supply, control and specify electric machines. Additionally, it can be used as a valuable reference for other engineering disciplines involved with electrical motors and generators.

## Solar PV and Wind Energy Conversion Systems#solar_pv_and_wind_energy_conversion_systems
### **S. Sumathi, L. Ashok Kumar, P. Surekha** 


  This textbook starts with a review of the principles of operation, modeling and control of common solar energy and wind-power generation systems before moving on to discuss grid compatibility, power quality issues and hybrid models of Solar PV and Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECS).

## Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Microanalysis#scanning_electron_microscopy_and_x_ray_microanalysis
### **Joseph I. Goldstein, Dale E. Newbury, Joseph R. Michael, Nicholas W.M. Ritchie, John Henry J. Scott, David C. Joy** 


  This thoroughly revised and updated Fourth Edition of a time-honored text provides the reader with a comprehensive introduction to the field of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) for elemental microanalysis, electron backscatter diffraction analysis (EBSD) for micro-crystallography and focused ion beams. Students and academic researchers will find the text to be an authoritative and scholarly resource, while SEM operators and a diversity of practitioners — engineers, technicians, physical and biological scientists, clinicians, and technical managers — will find that every chapter has been overhauled to meet the more practical needs of the technologist and working professional. In a break with the past, this Fourth Edition de-emphasizes the design and physical operating basis of the instrumentation, including the electron sources, lenses, detectors, etc. In the modern SEM, many of the low level instrument parameters are now controlled and optimized by the microscope’s software, and user access is restricted. Although the software control system provides efficient and reproducible microscopy and microanalysis, the user must understand the parameter space wherein choices are made to achieve effective andmeaningful microscopy, microanalysis, and micro-crystallography. Therefore, special emphasis is placed on beam energy, beam current, electron detector characteristics and controls, and ancillary techniques such as energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD).
With 13 years between the publication of the third and fourth editions, new coverage reflects the many improvements in the instrument and analysis techniques. The SEM has evolved into a powerful and versatile characterization platform in which morphology, elemental composition, and crystal structure can be evaluated simultaneously. Extension of the SEM into a "dual beam" platform incorporating both electron and ion columns allows precision modification of the specimen by focused ion beam milling. New coverage in the Fourth Edition includes the increasing use of field emission guns and SEM instruments with high resolution capabilities, variable pressure SEM operation, theory, and measurement of x-rays with high throughput silicon drift detector (SDD-EDS) x-ray spectrometers. In addition to powerful vendor- supplied software to support data collection and processing, the microscopist can access advanced capabilities available in free, open source software platforms, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ-Fiji for image processing and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) DTSA II for quantitative EDS x-ray microanalysis and spectral simulation, both of which are extensively used in this work. However, the user has a responsibility to bring intellect, curiosity, and a proper skepticism to information on a computer screen and to the entire measurement process. This book helps you to achieve this goal.* Realigns the text with the needs of a diverse audience from researchers and graduate students to SEM operators and technical managers

* Emphasizes practical, hands-on operation of the microscope, particularly user selection of the critical operating parameters to achieve meaningful results

* Provides step-by-step overviews of SEM, EDS, and EBSD and checklists of critical issues for SEM imaging, EDS x-ray microanalysis, and EBSD crystallographic measurements

* Makes extensive use of open source software: NIH ImageJ-FIJI for image processing and NIST DTSA II for quantitative EDS x-ray microanalysis and EDS spectral simulation.

* Includes case studies to illustrate practical problem solving

* Covers Helium ion scanning microscopy

* Organized into relatively self-contained modules – no need to "read it all" to understand a topic
* Includes an online supplement—an extensive "Database of Electronic–Solid Interactions"—which can be accessed on SpringerLink, in Chapter 3

## Differential Equations and Their Applications#differential_equations_and_their_applications
### **Martin Braun** 


  There are two major changes in the Fourth Edition of Differential Equations and Their Applications. The first concerns the computer programs in this text. In keeping with recent trends in computer science, we have replaced all the APL programs with Pascal and C programs. The Pascal programs appear in the text in place of the APL programs, where they are followed by the Fortran programs, while the C programs appear in Appendix C.

Mathematics is playing an ever more important role in the physical and biological sciences, provoking a blurring of boundaries between scientific disciplines and a resurgence of interest in the modern as well as the classical techniques of applied mathematics. This renewal of interest, both in research and teaching, has led to the establishment of the series: Texts in Applied Mathematics (TAM).
The development of new courses is a natural consequence of a high Ievel of excitement on the research frontier as newer techniques, such as numerical and symbolic computer systems, dynamical systems, and chaos, mix with and reinforce the traditional methods of applied mathematics. Thus, the purpose of this textbook series is to meet the current and future needs of these advances and encourage the teaching of new courses. TAM will publish textbooks suitable for use in advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate courses, and will complement the Applied Mathematical Sciences (AMS) series, which will focus on advanced textbooks and research Ievel monographs.

## Brownian Motion, Martingales, and Stochastic Calculus #brownian_motion_martingales_and_stochastic_calculus
### **Jean-François Le Gall** 


  This book offers a rigorous and self-contained presentation of stochastic integration and stochastic calculus within the general framework of continuous semimartingales. The main tools of stochastic calculus, including Itô’s formula, the optional stopping theorem and Girsanov’s theorem, are treated in detail alongside many illustrative examples. The book also contains an introduction to Markov processes, with applications to solutions of stochastic differential equations and to connections between Brownian motion and partial differential equations. The theory of local times of semimartingales is discussed in the last chapter.
Since its invention by Itô, stochastic calculus has proven to be one of the most important techniques of modern probability theory, and has been used in the most recent theoretical advances as well as in applications to other fields such as mathematical finance. Brownian Motion, Martingales, and Stochastic Calculus provides a strong theoretical background to the reader interested in such developments.
Beginning graduate or advanced undergraduate students will benefit from this detailed approach to an essential area of probability theory. The emphasis is on concise and efficient presentation, without any concession to mathematical rigor. The material has been taught by the author for several years in graduate courses at two of the most prestigious French universities. The fact that proofs are given with full details makes the book particularly suitable for self-study. The numerous exercises help the reader to get acquainted with the tools of stochastic calculus.

## Introductory Time Series with R#introductory_time_series_with_r
### **Andrew V. Metcalfe, Paul S.P. Cowpertwait** 


  Yearly global mean temperature and ocean levels, daily share prices, and the signals transmitted back to Earth by the Voyager space craft are all examples of sequential observations over time known as time series. This book gives you a step-by-step introduction to analysing time series using the open source software R. Each time series model is motivated with practical applications, and is defined in mathematical notation. Once the model has been introduced it is used to generate synthetic data, using R code, and these generated data are then used to estimate its parameters. This sequence enhances understanding of both the time series model and the R function used to fit the model to data. Finally, the model is used to analyse observed data taken from a practical application. By using R, the whole procedure can be reproduced by the reader. All the data sets used in the book are available on the website http://staff.elena.aut.ac.nz/Paul-Cowpertwait/ts/.

The book is written for undergraduate students of mathematics, economics, business and finance, geography, engineering and related disciplines, and postgraduate students who may need to analyse time series as part of their taught programme or their research.

Paul Cowpertwait is an associate professor in mathematical sciences (analytics) at Auckland University of Technology with a substantial research record in both the theory and applications of time series and stochastic models. Andrew Metcalfe is an associate professor in the School of Mathematical Sciences at the University of Adelaide, and an author of six statistics text books and numerous research papers. Both authors have extensive experience of teaching time series to students at all levels.

## Social Psychology in Action#social_psychology_in_action
### **Kai Sassenberg, Michael L.W.  Vliek** 


  This timely and applied textbook brings together leading scientists to illustrate how key theories and concepts in social psychology help to predict and explain behavior, and can be successfully applied to benefit social and practical problems. It focuses on robust theories and models known for their successful applications and covers a diverse range of settings—spanning classroom interventions, health behavior, financial decision making, climate change and much more. Each chapter comprises of a theoretical section to define the key concepts and summarize the theory, providing evidence for its reliability and limitations from basic research, as well as an application section that summarizes research in an applied context and provides details about a particular study including the respective application setting. The textbook expertly shows how theory can make meaningful predictions for real world contexts, and isn’t afraid to explain the potential hurdles and pitfalls when applying a theory and its underlying set of concepts in a certain context. Crucially, this format moves towards theory testing in applied contexts, enabling a closer examination of *why *and under *what circumstances *interventions may be successful in obtaining a desired behavioral or psychological end-state.

Among the topics explored:

* Mindset theory of action phases and if-then planning

* Quality of motivation in self-determination theory

* The focus theory of normative conduct

* Social identity theory and intergroup contact theory

* Intergroup forgiveness

*Social Psychology in Action* is a critical resource for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in social and cultural psychology, as well as students of behavioral economics seeking to develop a deeper understanding of major theories and applications of the fields. Practitioners working in the areas of organizational behavior and management, health communication, social work, and educational science and pedagogy will also find the volume pertinent to their work.

## Energy and the Wealth of Nations#energy_and_the_wealth_of_nations
### **Charles A.S. Hall, Kent Klitgaard** 


  In this updated edition of a groundbreaking text, concepts such as energy return on investment (EROI) provide powerful insights into the real balance sheets that drive our “petroleum economy.” Hall and Klitgaard explore the relation between energy and the wealth explosion of the 20th century, and the interaction of internal limits to growth found in the investment process and rising inequality with the biophysical limits posed by finite energy resources. The authors focus attention on the failure of markets to recognize or efficiently allocate diminishing resources, the economic consequences of peak oil, the high cost and relatively low EROI of finding and exploiting new oil fields, including the much ballyhooed shale plays and oil sands, and whether alternative energy technologies such as wind and solar power can meet the minimum EROI requirements needed to run society as we know it.
For the past 150 years, economics has been treated as a social science in which economies are modeled as a circular flow of income between producers and consumers. In this “perpetual motion” of interactions between firms that produce and households that consume, little or no accounting is given of the flow of energy and materials from the environment and back again. In the standard economic model, energy and matter are completely recycled in these transactions, and economic activity is seemingly exempt from the Second Law of Thermodynamics. As we enter the second half of the age of oil, when energy supplies and the environmental impacts of energy production and consumption are likely to constrain economic growth, this exemption should be considered illusory at best. This book is an essential read for all scientists and economists who have recognized the urgent need for a more scientific, empirical, and unified approach to economics in an energy-constrained world, and serves as an ideal teaching text for the growing number of courses, such as the authors’ own, on the role of energy in society.
* Includes several new chapters and comprehensive updates addressing the implications of hydraulic fracturing (fracking), access to energy and social inequality, as well as climate science and planetary boundaries

* Integrates energy and economics by combining natural and social sciences

* Uses predictive tools and measures, such as EROI, to show how the economy is embedded in a biophysical world subject to scientific rules and constraints

* Provides a fresh approach to economics for those wondering “What’s next?“ after the Great Recession and continued volatility in energy prices

* Offers economic analysis from the real-world perspective of peak oil, high energy prices, the role of alternative energy sources, and potential environmental impacts of energy use such as climate change

## Understanding Analysis#understanding_analysis
### **Stephen Abbott** 


  This lively introductory text exposes the student to the rewards of a rigorous study of functions of a real variable. In each chapter, informal discussions of questions that give analysis its inherent fascination are followed by precise, but not overly formal, developments of the techniques needed to make sense of them. By focusing on the unifying themes of approximation and the resolution of paradoxes that arise in the transition from the finite to the infinite, the text turns what could be a daunting cascade of definitions and theorems into a coherent and engaging progression of ideas. Acutely aware of the need for rigor, the student is much better prepared to understand what constitutes a proper mathematical proof and how to write one.

Fifteen years of classroom experience with the first edition of *Understanding Analysis* have solidified and refined the central narrative of the second edition. Roughly 150 new exercises join a selection of the best exercises from the first edition, and three more project-style sections have been added. Investigations of Euler’s computation of ζ(2), the Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, and the gamma function are now among the book’s cohort of seminal results serving as motivation and payoff for the beginning student to master the methods of analysis.

**Review of the first edition:**

“This is a dangerous book. *Understanding Analysis* is so well-written and the development of the theory so well-motivated t

hat exposing students to it could well lead them to expect such excellence in all their textbooks. … *Understanding Analysis* is perfectly titled; if your students read it, that’s what’s going to happen. … This terrific book will become the text of choice for the single-variable introductory analysis course … ”— Steve Kennedy, **MAA Reviews **

## Algebra#algebra
### **Serge Lang** 


  This book is intended as a basic text for a one-year course in Algebra at the graduate level, or as a useful reference for mathematicians and professionals who use higher-level algebra. It successfully addresses the basic concepts of algebra. For the revised third edition, the author has added exercises and made numerous corrections to the text.

Comments on Serge Lang's Algebra:
Lang's Algebra changed the way graduate algebra is taught, retaining classical topics but introducing language and ways of thinking from category theory and homological algebra. It has affected all subsequent graduate-level algebra books.
*April 1999 Notices of the AMS, announcing that the author * *was awarded the Leroy P. Steele Prize for Mathematical * *Exposition for his many mathematics books.*

The author has an impressive knack for presenting the important and interesting ideas of algebra in just the "right" way, and he never gets bogged down in the dry formalism which pervades some parts of algebra.
*MathSciNet's review of the first edition*

## Proofs from THE BOOK#proofs_from_the_book
### **Martin Aigner, Günter M. Ziegler** 


  This revised and enlarged sixth edition of *Proofs from THE BOOK* features an entirely new chapter on Van der Waerden’s permanent conjecture, as well as additional, highly original and delightful proofs in other chapters.

**From the citation on the occasion of the 2018 "Steele Prize for Mathematical Exposition"**

*“… It is almost impossible to write a mathematics book that can be read and enjoyed by people of all levels and backgrounds, yet Aigner and Ziegler accomplish this feat of exposition with virtuoso style. […] This book does an invaluable service to mathematics, by illustrating for non-mathematicians what it is that mathematicians mean when they speak about beauty.”*

**From the Reviews**

*"... Inside PFTB (Proofs from The Book) is indeed a glimpse of mathematical heaven, where clever insights and beautiful ideas combine in astonishing and glorious ways. There is vast wealth within its pages, one gem after another. ... Aigner and Ziegler... write: "... all we offer is the examples that we have selected, hoping that our readers will share our enthusiasm about brilliant ideas, clever insights and wonderful observations." I do. ... "*

Notices of the AMS, August 1999

*"... This book is a pleasure to hold and to look at: ample margins, nice photos, instructive pictures and beautiful drawings ... It is a pleasure to read as well: the style is clear and entertaining, the level is close to elementary, the necessary background is given separately and the proofs are brilliant. ..."*

LMS Newsletter, January 1999

*"Martin Aigner and Günter Ziegler succeeded admirably in putting together a broad collection of theorems and their proofs that would undoubtedly be in the Book of Erdös. The theorems are so fundamental, their proofs so elegant and the remaining open questions so intriguing that every mathematician, regardless of speciality, can benefit from reading this book. ... "*

## Grammar for Teachers#grammar_for_teachers
### **Andrea DeCapua** 


  Updated and revised with more examples and expanded discussions, this second edition continues the aim of providing teachers with a solid understanding of the use and function of grammatical structures in American English. The book avoids jargon and presents essential grammatical structures clearly and concisely. Dr. DeCapua approaches grammar from a descriptive rather than a prescriptive standpoint, discussing differences between formal and informal language, and spoken and written English. The text draws examples from a wide variety of authentic materials to illustrate grammatical concepts. The many activities throughout the book engage users in exploring the different elements of grammar and in considering how these elements work together to form meaning. Users are encouraged to tap into their own, often subconscious, knowledge of grammar to consciously apply their knowledge to their own varied teaching settings. The text also emphasizes the importance of understanding grammar from the perspective of English language learners, an approach that allows teachers to better appreciate the difficulties these learners face. Specific areas of difficulties for learners of English are highlighted throughout.

## Physical Chemistry from a Different Angle#physical_chemistry_from_a_different_angle
### **Georg Job, Regina Rüffler** 


  **Learning the basics of physical chemistry with a unique, innovative approach.** Georg Job and Regina Rueffler introduce readers to an almost intuitive understanding of the two fundamental concepts, chemical potential and entropy. Avoiding complex mathematics, these concepts are illustrated with the help of numerous demonstration experiments. Using these concepts, the subjects of chemical equilibria, kinetics and electrochemistry are presented at an undergraduate level. The basic quantities and equations necessary for the qualitative and quantitative description of chemical transformations are introduced by using everyday experiences and particularly more than one hundred illustrative experiments, many presented online as videos. These are in turn supplemented by nearly 400 figures, and by learning objectives for each chapter. From a review of the German edition: *“This book is the most revolutionary textbook on physical chemistry that has been published in the last few decades.”***

## The ASCRS Textbook of Colon and Rectal Surgery#the_ascrs_textbook_of_colon_and_rectal_surgery
### **Scott R. Steele, Tracy L. Hull, Thomas E. Read, Theodore J. Saclarides, Anthony J. Senagore, Charles B. Whitlow** 


  This third edition text* *provides a completely revised and updated new version of this unique, modern, practical text that covers the strategic evaluation, specific approaches, and detailed management techniques utilized by expert colorectal surgeons caring for patients with complex problems–whether they result from underlying colorectal disease or from complications arising from previous surgical therapy. The format follows that of both a “how to” manual as well as an algorithm-based guide to allow the reader to understand the thought process behind the proposed treatment strategy. By making use of evidence-based recommendations, each chapter includes not only background information and diagnostic/therapeutic guidelines, but also provides a narrative by the author on his/her operative technical details and perioperative “tips and tricks” that they utilize in the management of these complex surgical challenges. Distinctive to this book, is the reliance on experts in the field including past presidents of the ASCRS, as well as multiple other national and internationally recognized surgeons, to lend their personal insight into situations where data may be more sparse, but individual and collective experience is paramount to making sound decisions and thereby optimizing patient outcomes. The text includes chapters on the assessment of risk and methods utilized to minimize perioperative complications. In addition, it incorporates sections covering the medical and surgical therapies for abdominal, pelvic and anorectal disease. Moreover, the technical challenges of managing complications resulting from the original or subsequent operations is addressed. The underlying focus throughout the text is on providing pragmatic and understandable solutions that can be readily implemented by surgeons of varying experience to successfully treat complex colorectal problems. However, it also goes beyond the technical aspects of colorectal surgery and includes special sections highlighting the essence of a surgeon; covering aspects involving the medical-legal, ethical, and economic challenges confronting surgeons. Throughout the text, each author provides an ongoing narrative of his/her individual surgical techniques along with illustrations and diagrams to “personally” take the reader through the crucial steps of the procedure, and key points of patient care inherent to that topic. Additionally, where appropriate, links to online videos give the reader an up-front look into technical aspects of colorectal surgery.

## Introduction to Partial Differential Equations#introduction_to_partial_differential_equations
### **David Borthwick** 


  This modern take on partial differential equations does not require knowledge beyond vector calculus and linear algebra. The author focuses on the most important classical partial differential equations, including conservation equations and their characteristics, the wave equation, the heat equation, function spaces, and Fourier series, drawing on tools from analysis only as they arise.Within each section the author creates a narrative that answers the five questions:
(1) What is the scientific problem we are trying to understand?
(2) How do we model that with PDE?
(3) What techniques can we use to analyze the PDE?
(4) How do those techniques apply to this equation?
(5) What information or insight did we obtain by developing and analyzing the PDE?
The text stresses the interplay between modeling and mathematical analysis, providing a thorough source of problems and an inspiration for the development of methods.

### **Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani** 


  **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.**


Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. **An Introduction to Statistical Learning** covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.

## Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting#introduction_to_time_series_and_forecasting
### **Peter J. Brockwell, Richard A. Davis** 


  This book is aimed at the reader who wishes to gain a working knowledge of time series and forecasting methods as applied to economics, engineering and the natural and social sciences. It assumes knowledge only of basic calculus, matrix algebra and elementary statistics. This third edition contains detailed instructions for the use of the professional version of the Windows-based computer package ITSM2000, now available as a free download from the Springer Extras website. The logic and tools of time series model-building are developed in detail. Numerous exercises are included and the software can be used to analyze and forecast data sets of the user's own choosing. The book can also be used in conjunction with other time series packages such as those included in R. The programs in ITSM2000 however are menu-driven and can be used with minimal investment of time in the computational details.
The core of the book covers stationary processes, ARMA and ARIMA processes, multivariate time series and state-space models, with an optional chapter on spectral analysis. Many additional special topics are also covered.

**New to this edition:**

* A chapter devoted to Financial Time Series

* Introductions to Brownian motion, Lévy processes and Itô calculus

* An expanded section on continuous-time ARMA processes

**Peter J. Brockwell** and **Richard A. Davis** are Fellows of the American Statistical Association and the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and elected members of the International Statistics Institute. Richard A. Davis is the current President of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and, with W.T.M. Dunsmuir, winner of the Koopmans Prize. Professors Brockwell and Davis are coauthors of the widely used advanced text, T*ime Series: Theory and Methods, Second Edition* (Springer-Verlag, 1991).**


From reviews of the first edition:
<
*This book, like a good science fiction novel, is hard to put down.… Fascinating examples hold one’s attention and are taken from an astonishing variety of topics and fields.… Given that time series forecasting is really a simple idea, it is amazing how much beautiful mathematics this book encompasses. Each chapter is richly filled with examples that serve to illustrate and reinforce the basic concepts. The exercises at the end of each chapter are well designed and make good use of numerical problems. Combined with the ITSM package, this book is ideal as a textbook for the self-study student or the introductory course student. Overall then, as a text for a university-level course or as a learning aid for an industrial forecaster, I highly recommend the book. ***–SIAM Review**
*In addition to including ITSM, the book details all of the algorithms used in the package*—a quality which sets this text apart from all others at this level. This is an excellent idea for at least two reasons. It gives the practitioner the opportunity to use ITSM more intelligently by providing an extra source of intuition for understanding estimation and forecasting, and it allows the more adventurous practitioners to code their own algorithms for their individual purposes.… Overall I find Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting* to be a very useful and enlightening introduction to time series*. **–Journal of the American Statistical Association**
*The emphasis is on hands-on experience and the friendly software that accompanies the book serves the purpose admirably.… The authors should be congratulated for making the subject accessible and fun to learn. The book is a pleasure to read and highly recommended. I regard it as the best introductory text in town*. **–Short Book Reviews, International Statistical Review**

## The Psychology of Social Status#the_psychology_of_social_status
### **Joey T. Cheng, Jessica L. Tracy, Cameron Anderson** 


  Given the far-reaching effects of status on human societies, understanding the psychology of social status is crucial. Across all societies, differences in social rank or status not only determine who leads and who follows, but also the ways in which individuals resolve conflicts, allocate goods and resources, and coordinate to achieve shared group goals.

***The Psychology of Social Status*** outlines the foundational insights, key advances, and developments that have been made in the field thus far. The goal of this volume is to provide an in-depth exploration of the psychology of human status, by reviewing each of the major lines of theoretical and empirical work that have been conducted in this vein. Organized thematically, the volume covers the following areas:**


- An overview of several prominent overarching theoretical perspectives that have shaped much of the current research on social status.

- Examination of the personality, demographic, situational, emotional, and cultural underpinnings of status attainment, addressing questions about why and how people attain status.

- Identification of the intra- and inter-personal benefits and costs of possessing and lacking status.

- Emerging research on the biological and bodily manifestation of status attainment

- A broad review of available research methods for measuring and experimentally manipulating social status

​A key component of this volume is its interdisciplinary focus. Research on social status cuts across a variety of academic fields, including psychology, sociology, anthropology, organizational science others; thus the chapter authors are drawn from a similarly wide-range of disciplines. Encompassing the current state of knowledge in a thriving and proliferating field, ***The Psychology of Social Status ***is a fascinating and comprehensive resource for researchers, students, policy-makers, and others interested in learning about the complex nature of social status, hierarchy, dominance, and power.

## Regression Modeling Strategies#regression_modeling_strategies
### **Frank E. Harrell , Jr.** 


  This highly anticipated second edition features new chapters and sections, 225 new references, and comprehensive R software. In keeping with the previous edition, this book is about the art and science of data analysis and predictive modeling, which entails choosing and using multiple tools. Instead of presenting isolated techniques, this text emphasizes problem solving strategies that address the many issues arising when developing multivariable models using real data and not standard textbook examples. It includes imputation methods for dealing with missing data effectively, methods for fitting nonlinear relationships and for making the estimation of transformations a formal part of the modeling process, methods for dealing with "too many variables to analyze and not enough observations," and powerful model validation techniques based on the bootstrap. The reader will gain a keen understanding of predictive accuracy, and the harm of categorizing continuous predictors or outcomes. This text realistically deals with model uncertainty, and its effects on inference, to achieve "safe data mining." It also presents many graphical methods for communicating complex regression models to non-statisticians.

Regression Modeling Strategies presents full-scale case studies of non-trivial datasets instead of over-simplified illustrations of each method. These case studies use freely available R functions that make the multiple imputation, model building, validation, and interpretation tasks described in the book relatively easy to do. Most of the methods in this text apply to all regression models, but special emphasis is given to multiple regression using generalized least squares for longitudinal data, the binary logistic model, models for ordinal responses, parametric survival regression models, and the Cox semiparametric survival model. A new emphasis is given to the robust analysis of continuous dependent variables using ordinal regression.

As in

the first edition, this text is intended for Masters' or Ph.D. level graduate students who have had a general introductory probability and statistics course and who are well versed in ordinary multiple regression and intermediate algebra. The book will also serve as a reference for data analysts and statistical methodologists, as it contains an up-to-date survey and bibliography of modern statistical modeling techniques. Examples used in the text mostly come from biomedical research, but the methods are applicable anywhere predictive models ("analytics") are useful, including economics, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, engineering, and marketing.

## Taxation in European Union#taxation_in_european_union
### **Pietro Boria** 


  This book provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of the main topics of taxation in European law. The sequence of arguments follows an institutional logic, respecting the academic tradition of tax law. It first outlines the general framework of EU institutions, with a particular focus on the set of regulations regarding taxation with reference to the stage of formation of EU rules and the potential contrast with national legal systems. It then explores the general principles emerging from the European treaties that typically involve the taxation system, and examines in detail the fiscal importance of European freedoms, the principle of tax non-discrimination, the balance between national interest and EU values, tax harmonization, state aids and other general principles applicable in tax jurisdiction. Lastly, it offers an overall assessment of the development of the European integration process, with particular regard to the nexus between taxation power and sovereignty, in order to highlight the possible and desirable next stages of the evolution of “European tax law”.

## Introduction to Formal Philosophy#introduction_to_formal_philosophy
### **Sven Ove Hansson, Vincent F. Hendricks** 


  This Undergraduate Textbook introduces key methods and examines the major areas of philosophy in which formal methods play pivotal roles. Coverage begins with a thorough introduction to formalization and to the advantages and pitfalls of formal methods in philosophy. The ensuing chapters show how to use formal methods in a wide range of areas.



Throughout, the contributors clarify the relationships and interdependencies between formal and informal notions and constructions. Their main focus is to show how formal treatments of philosophical problems may help us understand them better. Formal methods can be used to solve problems but also to express new philosophical problems that would never have seen the light of day without the expressive power of the formal apparatus.

​Formal philosophy merges work in different areas of philosophy as well as logic, mathematics, computer science, linguistics, physics, psychology, biology, economics, political theory, and sociology. This title offers an accessible introduction to this new interdisciplinary research area to a wide academic audience.

## Logical Foundations of Cyber-Physical Systems#logical_foundations_of_cyber_physical_systems
### **André Platzer** 


  Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) combine cyber capabilities, such as computation or communication, with physical capabilities, such as motion or other physical processes. Cars, aircraft, and robots are prime examples, because they move physically in space in a way that is determined by discrete computerized control algorithms. Designing these algorithms is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior, while it is vital that these algorithms be correct because we rely on them for safety-critical tasks.

This textbook teaches undergraduate students the core principles behind CPSs. It shows them how to develop models and controls; identify safety specifications and critical properties; reason rigorously about CPS models; leverage multi-dynamical systems compositionality to tame CPS complexity; identify required control constraints; verify CPS models of appropriate scale in logic; and develop an intuition for operational effects.

The book is supported with homework exercises, lecture videos, and slides.

## Plant Physiology, Development and Metabolism#plant_physiology_development_and_metabolism
### **Satish C Bhatla, Manju A. Lal** 


  This book focuses on the fundamentals of plant physiology for undergraduate and graduate students. It consists of 34 chapters divided into five major units. Unit I discusses the unique mechanisms of water and ion transport, while Unit II describes the various metabolic events essential for plant development that result from plants’ ability to capture photons from sunlight, to convert inorganic forms of nutrition to organic forms and to synthesize high energy molecules, such as ATP. Light signal perception and transduction works in perfect coordination with a wide variety of plant growth regulators in regulating various plant developmental processes, and these aspects are explored in Unit III**.** Unit IV investigates plants’ various structural and biochemical adaptive mechanisms to enable them to survive under a wide variety of abiotic stress conditions (salt, temperature, flooding, drought), pathogen and herbivore attack (biotic interactions)**. **Lastly, Unit V** **addresses the large number of secondary metabolites produced by plants that are medicinally important for mankind and their applications in biotechnology and agriculture. Each topic is supported by illustrations, tables and information boxes, and a glossary of important terms in plant physiology is provided at the end.

## Fundamentals of Clinical Trials#fundamentals_of_clinical_trials
### **Lawrence M. Friedman, Curt D. Furberg, David L. DeMets, David M. Reboussin, Christopher B. Granger** 


  This is the fifth edition of a very successful textbook on clinical trials methodology, written by recognized leaders who have long and extensive experience in all areas of clinical trials. The three authors of the first four editions have been joined by two others who add great expertise. Most chapters have been revised considerably from the fourth edition. A chapter on regulatory issues has been included and the chapter on data monitoring has been split into two and expanded. Many contemporary clinical trial examples have been added. There is much new material on adverse events, adherence, issues in analysis, electronic data, data sharing, and international trials.

This book is intended for the clinical researcher who is interested in designing a clinical trial and developing a protocol. It is also of value to researchers and practitioners who must critically evaluate the literature of published clinical trials and assess the merits of each trial and the implications for the care and treatment of patients. The authors use numerous examples of published clinical trials to illustrate the fundamentals.

The text is organized sequentially from defining the question to trial closeout. One chapter is devoted to each of the critical areas to aid the clinical trial researcher. These areas include pre-specifying the scientific questions to be tested and appropriate outcome measures, determining the organizational structure, estimating an adequate sample size, specifying the randomization procedure, implementing the intervention and visit schedules for participant evaluation, establishing an interim data and safety monitoring plan, detailing the final analysis plan, and reporting the trial results according to the pre-specified objectives.

Although a basic introductory statistics course is helpful in maximizing the benefit of this book, a researcher or practitioner with limited statistical background would still find most if not all the chapters understandable and helpful. While the technical material has been kept to a minimum, the statistician may still find the principles and fundamentals presented in this text useful. This book has been successfully used for teaching courses in clinical trial methodology.

## A Beginner's Guide to Scala, Object Orientation and Functional Programming#a_beginner_s_guide_to_scala_object_orientation_and_functional_programming
### **John Hunt** 


  Scala is now an established programming language developed by Martin Oderskey and his team at the EPFL. The name Scala is derived from Sca(lable) La(nguage). Scala is a multi-paradigm language, incorporating object oriented approaches with functional programming.

Although some familiarity with standard computing concepts is assumed (such as the idea of compiling a program and executing this compiled from etc.) and with basic procedural language concepts (such as variables and allocation of values to these variables) the early chapters of the book do not assume any familiarity with object orientation nor with functional programming These chapters also step through other concepts with which the reader may not be familiar (such as list processing).

From this background, the book provides a practical introduction to both object and functional approaches using Scala. These concepts are introduced through practical experience taking the reader beyond the level of the language syntax to the philosophy and practice of object oriented development and functional programming.

Students and those actively involved in the software industry will find this comprehensive introduction to Scala invaluable.

## Quantum Theory for Mathematicians#quantum_theory_for_mathematicians
### **Brian C. Hall** 


  Although ideas from quantum physics play an important role in many parts of modern mathematics, there are few books about quantum mechanics aimed at mathematicians. This book introduces the main ideas of quantum mechanics in language familiar to mathematicians. Readers with little prior exposure to physics will enjoy the book's conversational tone as they delve into such topics as the Hilbert space approach to quantum theory; the Schrödinger equation in one space dimension; the Spectral Theorem for bounded and unbounded self-adjoint operators; the Stone–von Neumann Theorem; the Wentzel–Kramers–Brillouin approximation; the role of Lie groups and Lie algebras in quantum mechanics; and the path-integral approach to quantum mechanics.

The numerous exercises at the end of each chapter make the book suitable for both graduate courses and independent study. Most of the text is accessible to graduate students in mathematics who have had a first course in real analysis, covering the basics of L2 spaces and Hilbert spaces. The final chapters introduce readers who are familiar with the theory of manifolds to more advanced topics, including geometric quantization.

## Essentials of Business Analytics#essentials_of_business_analytics
### **Bhimasankaram Pochiraju, Sridhar Seshadri** 


  This comprehensive edited volume is the first of its kind, designed to serve as a textbook for long-duration business analytics programs. It can also be used as a guide to the field by practitioners. The book has contributions from experts in top universities and industry. The editors have taken extreme care to ensure continuity across the chapters.

The material is organized into three parts: A) Tools, B) Models and C) Applications. In Part A, the tools used by business analysts are described in detail. In Part B, these tools are applied to construct models used to solve business problems. Part C contains detailed applications in various functional areas of business and several case studies. Supporting material can be found in the appendices that develop the pre-requisites for the main text.



Every chapter has a business orientation. Typically, each chapter begins with the description of business problems that are transformed into data questions; and methodology is developed to solve these questions. Data analysis is conducted using widely used software, the output and results are clearly explained at each stage of development. These are finally transformed into a business solution. The companion website provides examples, data sets and sample code for each chapter.

## Handbook of LGBT Elders#handbook_of_lgbt_elders
### **Debra A. Harley, Pamela B. Teaster** 


  This groundbreaking resource presents a wealth of findings and perspectives previously unseen in the LGBT literature. Its focus on psychological, sociopolitical, and care delivery issues affecting LGBT elders reveals both the nuanced interplay between diverse sources of identity and multiple sources of stigma and discrimination.



Specific chapters highlight challenges and resiliencies impacting subpopulations (e.g., racial groups, veterans, immigrants), examine employment and advocacy issues, discuss later-life concerns in context, and offer guidelines for relevant, ethical practice. Contributors represent a wide range of fields from psychiatry and gerontology to public health and public policy, reflecting the scope and needs of this diverse and complex population.



Among the topics in the *Handbook*:



* Family relationships of older LGBT adults.
* The intersection of identities: race, age, sexuality, and care network.
* Bisexuality: an invisible community among LGBT elders.
* Implications of the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage.
* No money, no work, and you're old.
* Disabilities among LGBT elders: responses of medicine, public health, rehabilitation, and social work.


*Handbook of LGBT Elders* is an essential reference for mental health professionals, psychologists, and social workers who work with the LGBT community and the elderly, as well as researchers interested in the LGBT community and aging.

## Foundations of Quantum Mechanics#foundations_of_quantum_mechanics
### **Travis Norsen** 


  Authored by an acclaimed teacher of quantum physics and philosophy, this textbook pays special attention to the aspects that many courses sweep under the carpet. Traditional courses in quantum mechanics teach students how to use the quantum formalism to make calculations. But even the best students - indeed, *especially* the best students - emerge rather confused about what, exactly, the theory says is going on, physically, in microscopic systems. This supplementary textbook is designed to help such students understand that they are not alone in their confusions (luminaries such as Albert Einstein, Erwin Schroedinger, and John Stewart Bell having shared them), to sharpen their understanding of the most important difficulties associated with interpreting quantum theory in a realistic manner, and to introduce them to the most promising attempts to formulate the theory in a way that is physically clear and coherent.



The text is accessible to students with at least one semester of prior exposure to quantum (or "modern") physics and includes over a hundred engaging end-of-chapter "Projects" that make the book suitable for either a traditional classroom or for self-study.

 






 [![Foundations of Quantum Mechanics](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Pdflogogt.png)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-65867-4.pdf)
## Plant Physiological Ecology#plant_physiological_ecology
### **Hans Lambers, F. Stuart ChapinIII, Thijs L. Pons** 


  The growth, reproduction, and geographical distribution of plants are profoundly influenced by their physiological ecology: the interaction with the surrounding physical, chemical, and biological environments. This textbook describes mechanisms that underlie plant physiological ecology at the levels of physiology, biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology. At the same time, the integrative power of physiological ecology is well suited to assess the costs, benefits, and consequences of modifying plants for human needs and to evaluate the role of plants in ecosystems.

*Plant Physiological Ecology, Second Edition* is significantly updated, with full color illustrations and begins with the primary processes of carbon metabolism and transport, plant water relations, and energy balance. After considering individual leaves and whole plants, these physiological processes are then scaled up to the level of the canopy. Subsequent chapters discuss mineral nutrition and the ways in which plants cope with nutrient-deficient or toxic soils. The book then looks at patterns of growth and allocation, life-history traits, and interactions between plants and other organisms. Later chapters deal with traits that affect decomposition of plant material and with the consequences of plant physiological ecology at ecosystem and global levels.

*Plant Physiological Ecology, Second Edition* features numerous boxed entries that extend the discussions of selected issues, a glossary, and numerous references to the primary and review literature. This significant new text is suitable for use in plant ecology courses, as well as classes ranging from plant physiology to plant molecular biology.

*From reviews of the first edition:*

*"*. . . the authors cover a wide range of plant physiological aspects which up to now could not be found in one book. . . . The book can be recommended not only to students but also to scientists working in general plant physiology and ecology as well as in applied agriculture and forestry." - *Journal of Plant Physiology*

"This is a remarkable book, which should do much to consolidate the importance of plant physiological ecology as a strongly emerging discipline. The range and depth of the book should also persuade any remaining skeptics that plant physiological ecology can offer much in helping us to understand how plants function in a changing and complex environment." - *Forestry*

"This book must be regarded as the most integrated, informative and accessible account of the complexities of plant physiological ecology. It can be highly recommended to graduate students and researchers working in all fields of plant ecology." - *Plant Science*

". . . there is a wealth of information and new ideas here, and I strongly recommend that this book be on every plant ecophysiologist's shelf. It certainly represents scholarship of the highest level, and many of us will find it a useful source of new ideas for future research." - *Ecology*

## Handbook of Sociological Theory#handbook_of_sociological_theory
### **Jonathan H. Turner** 


  Sociology is experiencing what can only be described as hyperdifferentiation of theories - there are now many approaches competing for attention in the intellectual arena . From this perspective, we should see a weeding out of theories to a small number, but this is not likely to occur because each of the many theoretical perspectives has a resource base of adherents. As a result, theories in sociology do not compete head on with each other as much as they coexist.

This seminal reference work was brought together with an eye to capturing the diversity of theoretical activity in sociology - specifically the forefront of theory. Contributors describe what they themselves are doing right now rather than what others have done in the past. The goal of this volume is to allow prominent theorists working in a variety of traditions - who wouldn't usually come together - to review their work. The chapters in this volume represent a mix of theoretical orientations and strategies, but these these theories are diverse and represent the prominent theoretical discussions in sociology today. Some areas included are:

Section I: Theoretical Methodologies and Strategies

Section II: The Cultural Turn in Sociological Theorizing

Section III: Theorizing Interaction Processes

Section IV: Theorizing from the Systemic and Macrolevel

Section V: New Directions in Evolutionary Theorizing

Section VI: Theorizing on Power, Conflict, and Change

SectionVII: Theorizing from Assumptions of Rationality

This handbook will be of interest to those wanting a broad spectrum and overview of late 20th - early 21st century sociological theory.

## Communication and Bioethics at the End of Life#communication_and_bioethics_at_the_end_of_life
### **Lori A.  Roscoe, David P. Schenck** 


  This casebook provides a set of cases that reveal the current complexity of medical decision-making, ethical reasoning, and communication at the end of life for hospitalized patients and those who care for and about them. End-of-life issues are a controversial part of medical practice and of everyday life. Working through these cases illuminates both the practical and philosophical challenges presented by the moral problems that surface in contemporary end-of-life care. Each case involved real people, with varying goals and constraints,who tried to make the best decisions possible under demanding conditions. Though there were no easy solutions, nor ones that satisfied all stakeholders, there are important lessons to be learned about the ways end-of-life care can continue to improve. This advanced casebook is a must-read for medical and nursing students, students in the allied health professions, health communication scholars, bioethicists, those studying hospital and public administration, as well as for practicing physicians and educators.

## Developmental Neurobiology#developmental_neurobiology
### **Mahendra S. Rao, Marcus Jacobson†** 


  Developmental Neurobiology provides an up-to-date survey of the cellular events and the molecular contributors that contribute to the assembly of the vertebrate nervous system. The text will serve as a readily tractable source for advanced undergraduate neuroscience majors and beginning graduate students who will benefit from a single source to begin their study of a more detailed understanding of neural development. Each chapter is peppered with a sound mixture of historical context and descriptions from both the vertebrate and invertebrate literature that best illustrate specific aspects of development. The liberal use of simple diagrams and tables, which readily illustrate complex issues, is a welcome addition for instructor and student alike.

While classic topics of neural development, including axial patterning, cell proliferation, migration, cell death and synapse formation are covered, of particular interest are subjects that oftentimes received superficial coverage in texts, including separate, detailed chapters on oligodendrocyte and astrocyte development, and developmental mechanisms that relate to the process of aging. Multi-authored texts are often tricky to assemble for consistency, but Developmental Neurobiology succeeds in providing a sound introduction to the most exciting questions that neuroscientists will address experimentally for years to come.

Pat Levitt, Ph.D., Director, Vanderbilt Kennedy Center for Research on Human Development, Professor of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN

When the inaugural edition of Developmental Neurobiology appeared in 1970, it was the first attempt to comprehensively assess our understanding of neuronal development since the publication of S.R. Detwiler’s book Neuroembryology in 1936. Although progress had been made in the intervening 34 years, the author, Marcus Jacobson, was correct in noting that in 1970 "most aspects of neural ontogeny could be surveyed at a glance". In contrast, by the time the 3rd edition appeared in 1991, the size of the book had increased by 40% and the number of references cited went from around 2,000 to over 8,000. Since 1991, however, the field has grown at an even more rapid rate and has now reached a point that makes it virtually impossible for a single individual to comprehensively and authoritatively assess the entire gamut of neural ontogeny.

Before his death in 2001, Jacobson together with the co-editor of the present edition, M. Rao, conceived the plan for a 4th edition that would be multiauthored with each chapter being written by experts in a sub-field. Although one of the joys of reading the previous three editions was the consistency of Jacobson’s inimitable prose style, in the present book there remains a smoothness and consistency of style that is unusual and refreshing in a multiauthored text. In 14 chapters that begins with neural induction and ends with developmental mechanisms of aging, virtually all of the major topics of neural development are discussed in a clear and coherent fashion and with the aid of ample illustrations. The inclusion of historical antecedents , past and present controversies, technical and conceptual advances together with a comprehensive discussion of each topic all add up to an excellent assessment of the field as it enters the 21st century. Although one misses the Jacobsonian idiosyncrasies of previous editions, the 4th edition is a fitting legacy of Marcus Jacobson’s four decades of empirical and pedagogical contributions to developmental neurobiology.

## Handbook of Evolutionary Research in Archaeology#handbook_of_evolutionary_research_in_archaeology
### **Anna Marie Prentiss** 


  *Evolutionary Research in Archaeology* seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of contemporary evolutionary research in archaeology.




The book will provide a single source for introduction and overview of basic and advanced evolutionary concepts and research programs in archaeology. Content will be organized around four areas of critical research including microevolutionary and macroevolutionary process, human ecology studies (evolutionary ecology, demography, and niche construction), and evolutionary cognitive archaeology.



Given a focus on theory and application the book does not seek comprehensive coverage of the full range of empirical work as measured temporally and geographically. Authors of individual chapters will address theoretical foundations, history of research, contemporary contributions and debates, and implications for the future for their respective topics. As appropriate and within space limits authors could present or discuss short empirical case studies to illustrate key arguments.

## Handbook of Disaster Research#handbook_of_disaster_research
### **Havidán Rodríguez, Enrico L. Quarantelli, Russell R. Dynes** 


  From the reviews:

"The *Handbook of Disaster Research* will, without a doubt, be the most important publication of its type during this decade. Just about everyone who is anyone in the disaster research community has shared their knowledge on the important topics of the day. The authors and the publisher are to be congratulated for completing the book that will be widely sought after by practitioners, researchers and students of disaster planning and response. Thank you for this outstanding contribution to the field."

Henry W. Fischer III, Director, Center for Disaster Research & Education, Millersville University



"The *Handbook of Disaster Research* will generate considerable excitement amongst international disaster research and management professionals. Finally, a volume that takes on the task of articulating and unpacking the many social complexities of modern disasters and catastrophes. By taking a multi-disciplinary perspective, the Handbook addresses the very pressing need to better understand the social dimensions of disaster. ... offers a very balanced set of analyses that will undoubtedly appeal to not only the researcher, but the practitioner and the policy-maker alike."

Dr. Derek Bopping, Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Department of Defence, Australia



"This is an amazing handbook. .... A "must have" for anyone who wants to know the cutting edges of disaster research. The *Handbook of Disaster Research* is unlike any other handbook I’ve seen. .....I’m impressed, too, with the breadth of expertise that is represented. Practitioners as well as academics, the "old guard" of disaster research as well as the young, rising stars, and the refreshing appearance of scholars from places other than the United States. I need this book on my shelf."

Lee Clarke, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey Author of *Worst Cases: Terror and Catastrophe in the Popular Imagination; Mission Improbable: Using Fantasy Documents to Tame Disaster; and Terrorism and Disaster: New Threats, New Ideas*.

Recent disasters, such as the Indian Ocean Tsunami, bomb explosions in London, Hurricane Katrina, the Pakistan Earthquake, floods in Central America, landslides in Indonesia, and September 11, 2001 among many others, have resulted in an extensive loss of life, social disruption, significant economic impacts to local and national economies, and have made headline news in countries throughout the world. Thus the *Handbook of Disaster Research* is a timely and much needed contribution to the field of disasters.

## Automata and Computability#automata_and_computability
### **Dexter C. Kozen** 


  The aim of this textbook is to provide undergraduate students with an introduction to the basic theoretical models of computability, and to develop some of the model's rich and varied structure. Students who have already some experience with elementary discrete mathematics will find this a well-paced first course, and a number of supplementary chapters introduce more advanced concepts. The first part of the book is devoted to finite automata and their properties. Pushdown automata provide a broader class of models and enable the analysis of context-free languages. In the remaining chapters, Turing machines are introduced and the book culminates in discussions of effective computability, decidability, and Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Plenty of exercises are provided, ranging from the easy to the challenging. As a result, this text will make an ideal first course for students of computer science.

## Cryptography Made Simple#cryptography_made_simple
### **Nigel P. Smart** 


  In this introductory textbook the author explains the key topics in cryptography. He takes a modern approach, where defining what is meant by "secure" is as important as creating something that achieves that goal, and security definitions are central to the discussion throughout.
The chapters in Part 1 offer a brief introduction to the mathematical foundations: modular arithmetic, groups, finite fields, and probability; primality testing and factoring; discrete logarithms; elliptic curves; and lattices. Part 2 of the book shows how historical ciphers were broken, thus motivating the design of modern cryptosystems since the 1960s; this part also includes a chapter on information-theoretic security. Part 3 covers the core aspects of modern cryptography: the definition of security; modern stream ciphers; block ciphers and modes of operation; hash functions, message authentication codes, and key derivation functions; the "naive" RSA algorithm; public key encryption and signature algorithms; cryptography based on computational complexity; and certificates, key transport and key agreement. Finally, Part 4 addresses advanced prot ocols, where the parties may have different or even conflicting security goals: secret sharing schemes; commitments and oblivious transfer; zero-knowledge proofs; and secure multi-party computation.
The author balances a largely non-rigorous style — many proofs are sketched only — with appropriate formality and depth. For example, he uses the terminology of groups and finite fields so that the reader can understand both the latest academic research and "real-world" documents such as application programming interface descriptions and cryptographic standards. The text employs colour to distinguish between public and private information, and all chapters include summaries and suggestions for further reading.This is a suitable textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate students in computer science, mathematics and engineering, and for self-study by professionals in information security. While the appendix summarizes most of the basic algebra and notation required, it is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of discrete mathematics, probability, and elementary calculus.

## A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python#a_primer_on_scientific_programming_with_python
### **Hans Petter Langtangen** 


  The book serves as a first introduction to computer programming of scientific applications, using the high-level Python language. The exposition is example and problem-oriented, where the applications are taken from mathematics, numerical calculus, statistics, physics, biology and finance. The book teaches "Matlab-style" and procedural programming as well as object-oriented programming. High school mathematics is a required background and it is advantageous to study classical and numerical one-variable calculus in parallel with reading this book. Besides learning how to program computers, the reader will also learn how to solve mathematical problems, arising in various branches of science and engineering, with the aid of numerical methods and programming. By blending programming, mathematics and scientific applications, the book lays a solid foundation for practicing computational science.

*From the reviews: *Langtangen … does an excellent job of introducing programming as a set of skills in problem solving. He guides the reader into thinking properly about producing program logic and data structures for modeling real-world problems using objects and functions and embracing the object-oriented paradigm. … Summing Up: Highly recommended.

**F. H. Wild III, Choice, Vol. 47 (8), April 2010**

*Those of us who have learned scientific programming in Python ‘on the streets’ could be a little jealous of students who have the opportunity to take a course out of Langtangen’s Primer.”
***John D. Cook, The Mathematical Association of America, September 2011**

*This book goes through Python in particular, and programming in general, via tasks that scientists will likely perform. It contains valuable information for students new to scientific computing and would be the perfect bridge between an introduction to programming and an advanced course on numerical methods or computational science.
***Alex Small, IEEE, CiSE Vol. 14 (2), March**** ****/April 2012 **

“This fourth edition is a wonderful, inclusive textbook that covers pretty much everything one needs to know to go from zero to fairly sophisticated scientific programming in Python…”
**Joan Horvath, Computing Reviews, March 2015 **

## Philosophy of Science for Scientists#philosophy_of_science_for_scientists
### **Lars-Göran Johansson** 


  This textbook offers an introduction to the philosophy of science. It helps undergraduate students from the natural, the human and social sciences to gain an understanding of what science is, how it has developed, what its core traits are, how to distinguish between science and pseudo-science and to discover what a scientific attitude is. It argues against the common assumption that there is fundamental difference between natural and human science, with natural science being concerned with testing hypotheses and discovering natural laws, and the aim of human and some social sciences being to understand the meanings of individual and social group actions. Instead examines the similarities between the sciences and shows how the testing of hypotheses and doing interpretation/hermeneutics are similar activities. The book makes clear that lessons from natural scientists are relevant to students and scholars within the social and human sciences, and vice versa. It teaches its readers how to effectively demarcate between science and pseudo-science and sets criteria for true scientific thinking.




Divided into three parts, the book first examines the question What is Science? It describes the evolution of science, defines knowledge, and explains the use of and need for hypotheses and hypothesis testing. The second half of part I deals with scientific data and observation, qualitative data and methods, and ends with a discussion of theories on the development of science. Part II offers philosophical reflections on four of the most important concepts in science: causes, explanations, laws and models. Part III presents discussions on philosophy of mind, the relation between mind and body, value-free and value-related science, and reflections on actual trends in science.

## Sustainability Science#sustainability_science
### **Harald Heinrichs, Pim Martens, Gerd Michelsen, Arnim Wiek** 


  This textbook provides a comprehensive compilation of conceptual perspectives, methodological approaches and empirical insights of inter- and transdisciplinary sustainability science. Written by an international team of authors from leading sustainability institutions, the textbook covers key perspectives and topics of the scientific discourse on sustainable development. More than two decades after conceptualizing sustainability as societal guiding vision and regulative idea the necessity of concretizing and realizing sustainability in societal praxis is bigger than ever. Sharply improved individual and societal sustainable decision-making and action is necessary for a better future of humankind and the planet. On that account problem- and solution-oriented perspectives and competencies are crucial. The different chapters assemble an encompassing view of essential foundations and specific areas of research and action in sustainability science and practice. The textbook aims at fostering the further establishment of sustainability science in higher education and to enable the next generation of sustainability experts to tackle the challenging and exciting topic of sustainable development.

## Stability and Control of Linear Systems#stability_and_control_of_linear_systems
### **Andrea Bacciotti** 


  This advanced textbook introduces the main concepts and advances in systems and control theory, and highlights the importance of geometric ideas in the context of possible extensions to the more recent developments in nonlinear systems theory. Although inspired by engineering applications, the content is presented within a strong theoretical framework and with a solid mathematical background, and the reference models are always finite dimensional, time-invariant multivariable linear systems. The book focuses on the time domain approach, but also considers the frequency domain approach, discussing the relationship between the two approaches, especially for single-input-single-output systems. It includes topics not usually addressed in similar books, such as a comparison between the frequency domain and the time domain approaches, bounded input bounded output stability (including a characterization in terms of canonical decomposition), and static output feedback stabilization for which a simple and original criterion in terms of generalized inverse matrices is proposed.

The book is an ideal learning resource for graduate students of control theory and automatic control courses in engineering and mathematics, as well as a reference or self-study guide for engineers and applied mathematicians.

## Perspectives on Elderly Crime and Victimization#perspectives_on_elderly_crime_and_victimization
### **Peter C. Kratcoski, Maximilian Edelbacher** 


  This textbook focuses on the criminality and victimization of the elderly population. It provides a global perspective on the extent of elderly crime and victimization, with international comparisons for addressing the problem. It explores the extent and types of crimes committed by the elderly, the characteristics of older criminals, and the responses of the criminal justice system (including prisons and institutions) to elderly criminals, including: diversion programs, community-based treatment programs, and special programs including health & mental health care services for older prisoners.

The second part of the book covers victimization of the elderly. Research findings show that certain crimes including fraud, theft, and certain types of financial crimes disproportionately affect older people, and these types of crimes are growing in prevalence. This work explores the characteristics of older victims and the types of crimes that affect them.



Finally, the book presents comparative international research on approaches to crime prevention, education, and legislation to address the victimization of the elderly. This work will be of interest to students in criminology and criminal justice, as well as related fields such as sociology, and gerontology.

This book is designed to provide a bottoms-up approach to learning the VHDL language. This design supports a course in which foundational knowledge is covered before moving into advanced topics. However, this design also supports use as a reference manual. The author has designed the presentation with learning goals and assessment at its core. Each section addresses a specific learning outcome that the student should be able to “do” after its completion. The concept checks and exercise problems provide a rich set of assessment tools to measure student performance on each outcome.
* A comprehensive coverage of the basic capability of VHDL;

* Emphasizes examples from which students can learn: contains a solved example for nearly every section in the book;

* Includes more than 400 exercise problems, as well as concept check questions for each section, tied directly to specific learning outcomes.

## Abstract Algebra#abstract_algebra
### **Gregory T. Lee** 


  This carefully written textbook offers a thorough introduction to abstract algebra, covering the fundamentals of groups, rings and fields.

The first two chapters present preliminary topics such as properties of the integers and equivalence relations. The author then explores the first major algebraic structure, the group, progressing as far as the Sylow theorems and the classification of finite abelian groups. An introduction to ring theory follows, leading to a discussion of fields and polynomials that includes sections on splitting fields and the construction of finite fields. The final part contains applications to public key cryptography as well as classical straightedge and compass constructions.

Explaining key topics at a gentle pace, this book is aimed at undergraduate students. It assumes no prior knowledge of the subject and contains over 500 exercises, half of which have detailed solutions provided. 






 [![Abstract Algebra](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Pdflogogt.png)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-77649-1.pdf)
## Introduction to Law#introduction_to_law
### **Jaap Hage, Antonia Waltermann, Bram Akkermans** 


  This book is exceptional in the sense that it provides an introduction to law in general rather than the law of one specific jurisdiction, and it presents a unique way of looking at legal education. It is crucial for lawyers to be aware of the different ways in which societal problems can be solved and to be able to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different legal solutions. In this respect, being a lawyer involves being able to reason like a lawyer, even more than having detailed knowledge of particular sets of rules. Introduction to Law reflects this view by focusing on the functions of rules and on ways of arguing the relative qualities of alternative legal solutions. Where ‘positive’ law is discussed, the emphasis is on the legal questions that must be addressed by a field of law, and on the different solutions which have been adopted by, for instance, the common law and civil law tradition. The law of specific jurisdictions is discussed to illustrate possible answers to questions such as when the existence of a valid contract is assumed.

## Linear Algebra#linear_algebra
### **Jörg Liesen, Volker Mehrmann** 


  This self-contained textbook takes a matrix-oriented approach to linear algebra and presents a complete theory, including all details and proofs, culminating in the Jordan canonical form and its proof. Throughout the development, the applicability of the results is highlighted. Additionally, the book presents special topics from applied linear algebra including matrix functions, the singular value decomposition, the Kronecker product and linear matrix equations.
The matrix-oriented approach to linear algebra leads to a better intuition and a deeper understanding of the abstract concepts, and therefore simplifies their use in real world applications. Some of these applications are presented in detailed examples. In several ‘MATLAB-Minutes’ students can comprehend the concepts and results using computational experiments. Necessary basics for the use of MATLAB are presented in a short introduction. Students can also actively work with the material and practice their mathematical skills in more than 300 exercises.

## Bayesian Essentials with R#bayesian_essentials_with_r
### **Jean-Michel Marin, Christian P. Robert** 


  This Bayesian modeling book provides a self-contained entry to computational Bayesian statistics. Focusing on the most standard statistical models and backed up by real datasets and an all-inclusive R (CRAN) package called bayess, the book provides an operational methodology for conducting Bayesian inference, rather than focusing on its theoretical and philosophical justifications. Readers are empowered to participate in the real-life data analysis situations depicted here from the beginning. The stakes are high and the reader determines the outcome. Special attention is paid to the derivation of prior distributions in each case and specific reference solutions are given for each of the models. Similarly, computational details are worked out to lead the reader towards an effective programming of the methods given in the book. In particular, all R codes are discussed with enough detail to make them readily understandable and expandable. This works in conjunction with the bayess package.

*Bayesian Essentials with R* can be used as a textbook at both undergraduate and graduate levels, as exemplified by courses given at Université Paris Dauphine (France), University of Canterbury (New Zealand), and University of British Columbia (Canada). It is particularly useful with students in professional degree programs and scientists to analyze data the Bayesian way. The text will also enhance introductory courses on Bayesian statistics. Prerequisites for the book are an undergraduate background in probability and statistics, if not in Bayesian statistics. A strength of the text is the noteworthy emphasis on the role of models in statistical analysis.

This is the new, fully-revised edition to the book *Bayesian Core: A Practical Approach to Computational Bayesian Statistics.*

## Advanced Organic Chemistry#advanced_organic_chemistry
### **Francis A. Carey, Richard J. Sundberg** 


  Since its original appearance in 1977, Advanced Organic Chemistry has maintained its place as the premier textbook in the field, offering broad coverage of the structure, reactivity and synthesis of organic compounds. As in the earlier editions, the text contains extensive references to both the primary and review literature and provides examples of data and reactions that illustrate and document the generalizations. While the text assumes completion of an introductory course in organic chemistry, it reviews the fundamental concepts for each topic that is discussed.

The two-part fifth edition has been substantially revised and reorganized for greater clarity. Part A begins with the fundamental concepts of structure and stereochemistry, and the thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of reactivity. Major reaction types covered include nucleophilic substitution, addition reactions, carbanion and carbonyl chemistry, aromatic substitution, pericyclic reactions, radical reactions, and photochemistry.

Among the changes:



* Coverage of the importance of computational chemistry in modern organic chemistry, including applications to many specific reactions.


* Expanded coverage of stereoselectivity and enantioselectivity, including discussion of several examples of enantioselective reagents and catalysts


* Chapter 10, Concerted Pericyclic Reactions, has been reorganized and now begins with cycloaddition reactions.


* The treatment of photochemical reactions has been extensively updated to reflect both experimental and computational studies of the transient intermediates involved in photochemical reactions.


* A companion Web site provides digital models for study of structure, reaction and selectivity. Here students can view and manipulate computational models of reaction paths. These sites also provide exercises based on detailed study of the computational models.




* Several chapters in Part A conclude with Topics – short excursions into specific topics such as more detailed analysis of polar substituent effects, efforts to formulate substituent effects in terms of density functional theory, or the role of carbocations in petroleum refining


* Solutions to the chapter problems are provided to instructors online
Advanced Organic Chemistry Part A provides a close look at the structural concepts and mechanistic patterns that are fundamental to organic chemistry. It relates those mechanistic patterns, including relative reactivity and stereochemistry, to underlying structural factors. Understanding these concepts and relationships will allow students to recognize the cohesive patterns of reactivity in organic chemistry. Part A: Structure and Mechanism and Part B: Reaction and Synthesis - taken together - are intended to provide the advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate student in chemistry with a foundation to comprehend and use the research literature in organic chemistry

## Stochastic Processes and Calculus#stochastic_processes_and_calculus
### **Uwe Hassler** 


  This textbook gives a comprehensive introduction to stochastic processes and calculus in the fields of finance and economics, more specifically mathematical finance and time series econometrics. Over the past decades stochastic calculus and processes have gained great importance, because they play a decisive role in the modeling of financial markets and as a basis for modern time series econometrics. Mathematical theory is applied to solve stochastic differential equations and to derive limiting results for statistical inference on nonstationary processes.

This introduction is elementary and rigorous at the same time. On the one hand it gives a basic and illustrative presentation of the relevant topics without using many technical derivations. On the other hand many of the procedures are presented at a technically advanced level: for a thorough understanding, they are to be proven. In order to meet both requirements jointly, the present book is equipped with a lot of challenging problems at the end of each chapter as well as with the corresponding detailed solutions. Thus the virtual text - augmented with more than 60 basic examples and 40 illustrative figures - is rather easy to read while a part of the technical arguments is transferred to the exercise problems and their solutions.

## Statistical Learning from a Regression Perspective#statistical_learning_from_a_regression_perspective
### **Richard A. Berk** 


  This textbook considers statistical learning applications when interest centers on the conditional distribution of the response variable, given a set of predictors, and when it is important to characterize how the predictors are related to the response. As a first approximation, this can be seen as an extension of nonparametric regression.
This fully revised new edition includes important developments over the past 8 years. Consistent with modern data analytics, it emphasizes that a proper statistical learning data analysis derives from sound data collection, intelligent data management, appropriate statistical procedures, and an accessible interpretation of results. A continued emphasis on the implications for practice runs through the text. Among the statistical learning procedures examined are bagging, random forests, boosting, support vector machines and neural networks. Response variables may be quantitative or categorical. As in the first edition, a unifying theme is supervised learning that can be treated as a form of regression analysis.
Key concepts and procedures are illustrated with real applications, especially those with practical implications. A principal instance is the need to explicitly take into account asymmetric costs in the fitting process. For example, in some situations false positives may be far less costly than false negatives. Also provided is helpful craft lore such as not automatically ceding data analysis decisions to a fitting algorithm. In many settings, subject-matter knowledge should trump formal fitting criteria. Yet another important message is to appreciate the limitation of one’s data and not apply statistical learning procedures that require more than the data can provide.
The material is written for upper undergraduate level and graduate students in the social and life sciences and for researchers who want to apply statistical learning procedures to scientific and policy problems. The author uses this book in a course on modern regression for the social, behavioral, and biological sciences. Intuitive explanations and visual representations are prominent. All of the analyses included are done in R with code routinely provided.

## Statistics in Criminal Justice#statistics_in_criminal_justice
### **David Weisburd, Chester Britt** 


  *Statistics in Criminal Justice* takes an approach that emphasizes the application and interpretation of statistics in research in crime and justice. This text is meant for both students and researchers who want to gain a basic understanding of common statistical methods used in this field. In general, the text relies on a building-block approach, meaning that each chapter helps to prepare the student for the chapters that follow. It also means that the level of sophistication of the text increases as the text progresses. Throughout the text there is an emphasis on comprehension and interpretation, rather than computation. However, as the statistical methods discussed become more complex and demanding to compute, there is increasing use and integration of statistical software. This approach is meant to provide the reader with an accessible, yet sophisticated understanding of statistics that can be used to examine real-life criminal justice problems with popular statistical software programs. The primary goal of the text is to give students and researchers a basic understanding of statistical concepts and methods that will leave them with the confidence and the tools for tackling more complex problems on their own.



New to the 4th Edition:

• New chapter on experimental design and the analysis of experimental data.

• New chapter on multi-level models

• More advanced discussions of statistical power, multi-nomial and ordinal regression.

• New computer exercises throughout the text to illustrate the use of both SPSS and Stata.

• Revision of exercises at the end of each chapter that places greater emphasis on using statistical software.

• Additional resources on the text’s web site for instructors and students, including answers to selected problems, syntax for replicating text examples in SPSS and Stata, and other materials that can be used to supplement the use of the text.

## Quantitative Methods for the Social Sciences#quantitative_methods_for_the_social_sciences
### **Daniel Stockemer** 


  This textbook offers an essential introduction to survey research and quantitative methods. Building on the premise that statistical methods need to be learned in a practical fashion, the book guides students through the various steps of the survey research process and helps to apply those steps toward a real example.
In detail, the textbook introduces students to the four pillars of survey research and quantitative analysis: (1) the importance of survey research, (2) preparing a survey, (3) conducting a survey and (4) analyzing a survey. Students are shown how to create their own questionnaire based on some theoretically derived hypotheses to achieve empirical findings for a solid dataset. Lastly, they use said data to test their hypotheses in a bivariate and multivariate realm.
The book explains the theory, rationale and mathematical foundations of these tests. In addition, it provides clear instructions on how to conduct the tests in SPSS and Stata. Given the breadth of its coverage, the textbook is suitable for introductory statistics, survey research or quantitative methods classes in the social sciences.

## Problems in Classical Electromagnetism#problems_in_classical_electromagnetism
### **Andrea Macchi, Giovanni Moruzzi, Francesco Pegoraro** 


  This book contains 157 problems in classical electromagnetism, most of them new and original compared to those found in other textbooks. Each problem is presented with a title in order to highlight its inspiration in different areas of physics or technology, so that the book is also a survey of historical discoveries and applications of classical electromagnetism. The solutions are complete and include detailed discussions, which take into account typical questions and mistakes by the students. Without unnecessary mathematical complexity, the problems and related discussions introduce the student to advanced concepts such as unipolar and homopolar motors, magnetic monopoles, radiation pressure, angular momentum of light, bulk and surface plasmons, radiation friction, as well as to tricky concepts and ostensible ambiguities or paradoxes related to the classical theory of the electromagnetic field. With this approach the book is both a teaching tool for undergraduates in physics, mathematics and electric engineering, and a reference for students wishing to work in optics, material science, electronics, plasma physics.

## Introduction to Evolutionary Computing#introduction_to_evolutionary_computing
### **A.E. Eiben, J.E. Smith** 


  The overall structure of this new edition is three-tier: Part I presents the basics, Part II is concerned with methodological issues, and Part III discusses advanced topics. In the second edition the authors have reorganized the material to focus on problems, how to represent them, and then how to choose and design algorithms for different representations. They also added a chapter on problems, reflecting the overall book focus on problem-solvers, a chapter on parameter tuning, which they combined with the parameter control and "how-to" chapters into a methodological part, and finally a chapter on evolutionary robotics with an outlook on possible exciting developments in this field.

The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate courses in artificial intelligence and computational intelligence, and for self-study by practitioners and researchers engaged with all aspects of bioinspired design and optimization.

## Data Science and Predictive Analytics#data_science_and_predictive_analytics
### **Ivo D. Dinov** 


  Over the past decade, Big Data have become ubiquitous in all economic sectors, scientific disciplines, and human activities. They have led to striking technological advances, affecting all human experiences. Our ability to manage, understand, interrogate, and interpret such extremely large, multisource, heterogeneous, incomplete, multiscale, and incongruent data has not kept pace with the rapid increase of the volume, complexity and proliferation of the deluge of digital information. There are three reasons for this shortfall. First, the volume of data is increasing much faster than the corresponding rise of our computational processing power (Kryder’s law > Moore’s law). Second, traditional discipline-bounds inhibit expeditious progress. Third, our education and training activities have fallen behind the accelerated trend of scientific, information, and communication advances. There are very few rigorous instructional resources, interactive learning materials, and dynamic training environments that support active data science learning. The textbook balances the mathematical foundations with dexterous demonstrations and examples of data, tools, modules and workflows that serve as pillars for the urgently needed bridge to close that supply and demand predictive analytic skills gap.

Exposing the enormous opportunities presented by the tsunami of Big data, this textbook aims to identify specific knowledge gaps, educational barriers, and workforce readiness deficiencies. Specifically, it focuses on the development of a transdisciplinary curriculum integrating modern computational methods, advanced data science techniques, innovative biomedical applications, and impactful health analytics.


The content of this graduate-level textbook fills a substantial gap in integrating modern engineering concepts, computational algorithms, mathematical optimization, statistical computing and biomedical inference. Big data analytic techniques and predictive scientific methods demand broad transdisciplinary knowledge, appeal to an extremely wide spectrum of readers/learners, and provide incredible opportunities for engagement throughout the academy, industry, regulatory and funding agencies.

## Computer Vision#computer_vision
### **Richard Szeliski** 


  Humans perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art?

*Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications* explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.

More than just a source of “recipes,” this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniques

**Topics and features:**

* Structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses
* Presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects
* Provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory
* Suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book
* Supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/
Suitable for an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in computer science or engineering, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries. Its design and exposition also make it eminently suitable as a unique reference to the fundamental techniques and current research literature in computer vision.

**Dr. Richard Szeliski** has more than 25 years’ experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft Research. This text draws on that experience, as well as on computer vision courses he has taught at the University of Washington and Stanford.**

## Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with Verilog#introduction_to_logic_circuits_logic_design_with_verilog
### **Brock J. LaMeres** 


  This textbook for courses in Digital Systems Design introduces students to the fundamental hardware used in modern computers. Coverage includes both the classical approach to digital system design (i.e., pen and paper) in addition to the modern hardware description language (HDL) design approach (computer-based). Using this textbook enables readers to design digital systems using the modern HDL approach, but they have a broad foundation of knowledge of the underlying hardware and theory of their designs. This book is designed to match the way the material is actually taught in the classroom. Topics are presented in a manner which builds foundational knowledge before moving onto advanced topics. The author has designed the presentation with learning Goals and assessment at its core. Each section addresses a specific learning outcome that the student should be able to “do” after its completion. The concept checks and exercise problems provide a rich set of assessment tools to measure student performance on each outcome.

* · Written the way the material is taught, enabling a bottom-up approach to learning which culminates with a high-level of learning, with a solid foundation;

* · Emphasizes examples from which students can learn: contains a solved example for nearly every section in the book;

* · Includes more than 600 exercise problems, as well as concept check questions for each section, tied directly to specific learning outcomes.

## Social Anxiety and Social Phobia in Youth#social_anxiety_and_social_phobia_in_youth
### **Christopher A. Kearney** 


  A great bene?t of being a clinical child psychologist is the opportunity to conduct and review research on fascinating areas of human, youthful behavior. And perhaps no behavior is as central to human existence as social behavior, and the lack thereof. In writing this book, therefore, I have been doubly blessed with the chance to examine seminal works on behaviors that are so critical to the development and quality of life of children. This book covers the major historical aspects, characteristics, asse- ment strategies, and psychological treatment techniques for youths with social anxiety and social phobia. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the related constructs and history of social phobia. Chapters 2 and 3 provide a summary of the characteristics and etiological variables that pertain most to youths with social anxiety and social phobia. Chapters 4 and 5 provide an overview of research- and clinically-based assessment strategies and recommendations for this population. Chapters 6–9 provide a description of treatment techniques that are most relevant and empirically supported for youths with social anxiety and social phobia. Chapter 10 covers issues regarding general and relapse prevention as well as dif?cult cases and future directions.

## Philosophy of Race#philosophy_of_race
### **Naomi Zack** 


  *Philosophy of Race: An Introduction* provides plainly written access to a new subfield that has been in the background of philosophy since Plato and Aristotle. Part I provides an overview of ideas of race and ethnicity in the philosophical canon, egalitarian traditions, race in biology, and race in American and Continental Philosophy. Part II addresses race as it operates in life through colonialism and development, social constructions and institutions, racism, political philosophy, and gender. This book constructs an outline that will serve as a resource for students, nonspecialists, and general readers in thinking, talking, and writing about philosophy of race.

## Fundamentals of Business Process Management#fundamentals_of_business_process_management
### **Marlon Dumas, Marcello La Rosa, Jan Mendling, Hajo A. Reijers** 


  Business Process Management (BPM) is the art and science of how work should be performed in an organization in order to ensure consistent outputs and to take advantage of improvement opportunities, e.g. reducing costs, execution times or error rates. Importantly, BPM is not about improving the way individual activities are performed, but rather about managing entire chains of events, activities and decisions that ultimately produce added value for an organization and its customers.

This textbook encompasses the entire BPM lifecycle, from process identification to process monitoring, covering along the way process modelling, analysis, redesign and automation. Concepts, methods and tools from business management, computer science and industrial engineering are blended into one comprehensive and inter-disciplinary approach. The presentation is illustrated using the BPMN industry standard defined by the Object Management Group and widely endorsed by practitioners and vendors worldwide.

In addition to explaining the relevant conceptual background, the book provides dozens of examples, more than 100 hands-on exercises – many with solutions – as well as numerous suggestions for further reading. The textbook is the result of many years of combined teaching experience of the authors, both at the undergraduate and graduate levels as well as in the context of professional training. Students and professionals from both business management and computer science will benefit from the step-by-step style of the textbook and its focus on fundamental concepts and proven methods. Lecturers will appreciate the class-tested format and the additional teaching material available on the accompanying website fundamentals-of-bpm.org.

## Essentials of Cerebellum and Cerebellar Disorders#essentials_of_cerebellum_and_cerebellar_disorders
### **Donna L. Gruol, Noriyuki Koibuchi, Mario Manto, Marco Molinari, Jeremy D. Schmahmann, Ying Shen** 


  Essentials of the Cerebellum and Cerebellar Disorders is the first book of its kind written specifically for graduate students and clinicians. It is based on the 4-volume treatise, Handbook of the Cerebellum and Cerebellar Disorders (Springer, 2013), the definitive reference for scientists and neurologists in the field of cerebellar neurobiology. There have been fundamental advances in the basic science and clinical neurology of the cerebellum and its role in sensorimotor function and cognition. This monograph makes this large and expanding body of knowledge readily accessible to trainees and clinicians alike. The editors are world leaders in the field, and the chapters are authored by an international panel of experts drawn from ataxia clinics and cerebellar laboratories throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Essentials provides a solid grounding in the field of cerebellar research and ataxiology from cerebellar circuity to clinical practice, and it serves as a springboard to a deeper appreciation of both the principles and the complexities of cerebellar neurobiology. Clinicians are expected to have a deep appreciation of cerebellar disorders, not only in specialized ataxia clinics but also in adult and pediatric neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry and neuropsychology practices, and in outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation settings. This book is an indispensable resource for students and practitioners navigating the evolving field of cerebellar motor and cognitive neurology. It also links to the more expansive Handbook for those who need to explore the topics in this monograph in greater depth.

## Linear Algebra Done Right#linear_algebra_done_right
### **Sheldon Axler** 


  This best-selling textbook for a second course in linear algebra is aimed at undergrad math majors and graduate students. The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and to simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra.

The third edition contains major improvements and revisions throughout the book. More than 300 new exercises have been added since the previous edition. Many new examples have been added to illustrate the key ideas of linear algebra. New topics covered in the book include product spaces, quotient spaces, and dual spaces. Beautiful new formatting creates pages with an unusually pleasant appearance in both print and electronic versions.

No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. Thus the text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner-product spaces are introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator.

## Conferencing and Presentation English for Young Academics#conferencing_and_presentation_english_for_young_academics
### **Michael Guest** 


  This book discusses and demonstrates the types of English discourse used at academic conferences and offers guidance to prospective conference participants from multiple perspectives. It is a combination of research taken from numerous academic conferences attended and observations made by the author, based on well-established research methods in applied linguistics, as well as a guidebook aimed at students, ESP teachers, and young academics and professionals wishing to upgrade their skills to participate fruitfully in, and contribute to, academic conferences. It offers academic novices and non-native speakers of English in particular much that is new and practical, far beyond the realm of simple ‘presentation tips’. It addresses various topics, such as chairing discussions, poster management, discussion sessions, the TED phenomenon, workshops, and the emerging field of English as a lingua franca. The style alternates between the accessible and practical, and the analysis of the linguistic categories underpinning the discourse: genre analysis, the nature of the specialist discourse community, features of academic spoken discourse, and the presentation as multimodal narrative are all explored. The book includes authentic samples of model speech discourse throughout, along with questions and exercises for deliberation or practice in each chapter.

## Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology#principles_of_terrestrial_ecosystem_ecology
### **F. Stuart ChapinIII, Pamela A. Matson, Peter M. Vitousek** 


  Humans have directly modified half of the ice-free terrestrial surface and use 40% of terrestrial production. We are causing the sixth major extinction event in the history of life on Earth. With the Earth’s climate, flora, and fauna changing rapidly, there is a pressing need to understand terrestrial ecosystem processes and their sensitivity to environmental and biotic changes. This book offers a framework to do just that.




Ecosystem ecology regards living organisms, including people, and the elements of their environment as components of a single integrated system. The comprehensive coverage in this textbook examines the central processes at work in terrestrial ecosystems, including their freshwater components. It traces the flow of energy, water, carbon, and nutrients from their abiotic origins to their cycles through plants, animals, and decomposer organisms. As well as detailing the processes themselves, the book goes further to integrate them at various scales of magnitude—those of the ecosystem, the wider landscape and the globe. It synthesizes recent advances in ecology with established and emerging ecosystem theory to offer a wide-ranging survey of ecosystem patterns and processes in our terrestrial environment.



Featuring review questions at the end of each chapter, suggestions for further reading, and a glossary of ecological terms, *Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology* is a vitally relevant text suitable for study in all courses in ecosystem ecology. Resource managers and researchers in many fields will welcome its thorough presentation of ecosystem essentials.

## Corporate Social Responsibility#corporate_social_responsibility
### **John O. Okpara, Samuel O. Idowu** 


  In today's global business environment it is no longer acceptable that a corporation does well simply by doing good. It is expected. With increasing pressures from stakeholders to improve the bottom line as well as to be good corporate citizens, business leaders face tough decisions. What social issues should we support? What initiatives should we develop that will do the most good for the company as well as the cause? Do we include social messages in our advertising, encourage our employees to volunteer, do we modify our business practices? How do we integrate a new initiative into current strategies? These and other challenges will continue to face future leaders.

This book provides thoughtful answers to these important questions, and to many more. The book offers suggestions on how to choose among major worthy causes and also how to measure the amount of good achieved both for the recipients and the companies themselves. Of course, all is not only about challenges, there are loads of opportunities that go along with them but it’s only responsible and sustainable leaders who would be able to spot these opportunities. That is the future which awaits 21st century leaders.

## A Beginners Guide to Python 3 Programming#a_beginners_guide_to_python_3_programming
### **John Hunt** 


  This textbook on Python 3 explains concepts such as variables and what they represent, how data is held in memory, how a for loop works and what a string is. It also introduces key concepts such as functions, modules and packages as well as object orientation and functional programming. Each section is prefaced with an introductory chapter, before continuing with how these ideas work in Python.

Topics such as generators and coroutines are often misunderstood and these are explained in detail, whilst topics such as Referential Transparency, multiple inheritance and exception handling are presented using examples.

*A Beginners Guide to Python 3 Programming* provides all you need to know about Python, with numerous examples provided throughout including several larger worked case studies illustrating the ideas presented in the previous chapters.

## Introductory Quantum Mechanics#introductory_quantum_mechanics
### **Paul R. Berman** 


  This book presents a basic introduction to quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level. Depending on the choice of topics, it can be used for a one-semester or two-semester course. An attempt has been made to anticipate the conceptual problems students encounter when they first study quantum mechanics. Wherever possible, examples are given to illustrate the underlying physics associated with the mathematical equations of quantum mechanics. To this end, connections are made with corresponding phenomena in classical mechanics and electromagnetism. The problems at the end of each chapter are intended to help students master the course material and to explore more advanced topics. Many calculations exploit the extraordinary capabilities of computer programs such as Mathematica, MatLab, and Maple. Students are urged to use these programs, just as they had been urged to use calculators in the past. The treatment of various topics is rather complete, in that most steps in derivations are included. Several of the chapters go beyond what is traditionally covered in an introductory course. The goal of the presentation is to provide the students with a solid background in quantum mechanics.

## Stellar Structure and Evolution#stellar_structure_and_evolution
### **Rudolf Kippenhahn, Alfred Weigert, Achim Weiss** 


  This long-awaited *second edition* of the classical textbook on *Stellar Structure and Evolution* by Kippenhahn and Weigert is a thoroughly revised version of the original text. Taking into account modern observational constraints as well as additional physical effects such as mass loss and diffusion, Achim Weiss and Rudolf Kippenhahn have succeeded in bringing the book up to the state-of-the-art with respect to both the presentation of stellar physics and the presentation and interpretation of current sophisticated stellar models. The well-received and proven pedagogical approach of the first edition has been retained.

The book provides a comprehensive treatment of the physics of the stellar interior and the underlying fundamental processes and parameters. The models developed to explain the stability, dynamics and evolution of the stars are presented and great care is taken to detail the various stages in a star’s life. Just as the first edition, which remained a standard work for more than 20 years after its first publication, the second edition will be of lasting value not only for students but also for active researchers in astronomy and astrophysics.

## Recommender Systems#recommender_systems
### **Charu C. Aggarwal** 


  This book comprehensively covers the topic of recommender systems, which provide personalized recommendations of products or services to users based on their previous searches or purchases. Recommender system methods have been adapted to diverse applications including query log mining, social networking, news recommendations, and computational advertising. This book synthesizes both fundamental and advanced topics of a research area that has now reached maturity. The chapters of this book are organized into three categories:

- Algorithms and evaluation: These chapters discuss the fundamental algorithms in recommender systems, including collaborative filtering methods, content-based methods, knowledge-based methods, ensemble-based methods, and evaluation.

- Recommendations in specific domains and contexts: the context of a recommendation can be viewed as important side information that affects the recommendation goals. Different types of context such as temporal data, spatial data, social data, tagging data, and trustworthiness are explored.- Advanced topics and applications: Various robustness aspects of recommender systems, such as shilling systems, attack models, and their defenses are discussed.

In addition, recent topics, such as learning to rank, multi-armed bandits, group systems, multi-criteria systems, and active learning systems, are introduced together with applications.

Although this book primarily serves as a textbook, it will also appeal to industrial practitioners and researchers due to its focus on applications and references. Numerous examples and exercises have been provided, and a solution manual is available for instructors.About the Author: Charu C. Aggarwal is a Distinguished Research Staff Member (DRSM) at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York.

## Elementary Mechanics Using Matlab#elementary_mechanics_using_matlab
### **Anders Malthe-Sørenssen** 


  This book – specifically developed as a novel textbook on elementary classical mechanics – shows how analytical and numerical methods can be seamlessly integrated to solve physics problems. This approach allows students to solve more advanced and applied problems at an earlier stage and equips them to deal with real-world examples well beyond the typical special cases treated in standard textbooks.

Another advantage of this approach is that students are brought closer to the way physics is actually discovered and applied, as they are introduced right from the start to a more exploratory way of understanding phenomena and of developing their physical concepts.

While not a requirement, it is advantageous for the reader to have some prior knowledge of scientific programming with a scripting-type language. This edition of the book uses Matlab, and a chapter devoted to the basics of scientific programming with Matlab is included. A parallel edition using Python instead of Matlab is also available.

Last but not least, each chapter is accompanied by an extensive set of course-tested exercises and solutions.

## The Sea Floor#the_sea_floor
### **Eugen Seibold, Wolfgang Berger** 


  This textbook deals with the most important items in Marine Geology, including some pioneer work. The list of topics has grown greatly in the last few decades beyond the items identified by Eugen Seibold as central and now includes prominently such things as methane and climate change; that is, the carbon cycle and the Earth system as a whole.

Relevant geophysical, geochemical, sedimentological and paleontological methods are shortly described. They should allow the reader to comment on new results about plate tectonics, marine sedimentation from the coasts to the deep sea, climatological aspects, paleoceanology and the use of the sea floor.

The text tries to transmit to the reader excitement of marine geological research both aboard and in modern laboratories. Basic mineralogical, geochemical, biological and other relevant data and a detailed list of books and symposia are given in an Appendix. This Introduction builds on the third edition of “The Sea Floor” by E. Seibold and W.H. Berger. While much of the original text was written by Seibold, a considerable portion of the material presented in this edition is new, taking into account the recent great shift in marine geological research, some of it with great relevance to human concerns arising in a rapidly changing world.

## Control Engineering#control_engineering
### **László Keviczky, Ruth Bars, Jenő Hetthéssy, Csilla Bányász** 


  This book offers fundamental information on the analysis and synthesis of continuous and sampled data control systems. It includes all the required preliminary materials (from mathematics, signals and systems) that are needed in order to understand control theory, so readers do not have to turn to other textbooks. Sampled data systems have recently gained increasing importance, as they provide the basis for the analysis and design of computer-controlled systems. Though the book mainly focuses on linear systems, input/output approaches and state space descriptions are also provided. Control structures such as feedback, feed forward, internal model control, state feedback control, and the Youla parameterization approach are discussed, while a closing section outlines advanced areas of control theory.Though the book also contains selected examples, a related exercise book provides Matlab/Simulink exercises for all topics discussed in the textbook, helping readers to understand the theory and apply it in order to solve control problems. Thanks to this combination, readers will gain a basic grasp of systems and control, and be able to analyze and design continuous and discrete control systems.

## Plate Tectonics#plate_tectonics
### **Wolfgang Frisch, Martin Meschede, Ronald C. Blakey** 


  How are mountains formed? Why are there old and young mountains? Why do the shapes of South America and Africa fit so well together? Why is the Pacific surrounded by a ring of volcanoes and earthquake-prone areas while the edges of the Atlantic are relatively peaceful?

Frisch and Meschede and Blakey answer all these questions and more through the presentation and explanation of the geodynamic processes upon which the theory of continental drift is based and which have led to the concept of plate tectonics.

 






 [![Plate Tectonics](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Pdflogogt.png)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-540-76504-2.pdf)
## Object-Oriented Analysis, Design and Implementation#object_oriented_analysis_design_and_implementation
### **Brahma Dathan, Sarnath Ramnath** 


  The second edition of this textbook includes revisions based on the feedback on the first edition. In a new chapter the authors provide a concise introduction to the remainder of UML diagrams, adopting the same holistic approach as the first edition.

Using a case-study-based approach for providing a comprehensive introduction to the principles of object-oriented design, it includes:

* A sound footing on object-oriented concepts such as classes, objects, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, dynamic linking, etc.
* A good introduction to the stage of requirements analysis
* Use of UML to document user requirements and design
* An extensive treatment of the design process
* Coverage of implementation issues
* Appropriate use of design and architectural patterns
* Introduction to the art and craft of refactoring
* Pointers to resources that further the reader's knowledge
The focus of the book is on implementation aspects, without which the learning is incomplete. This is achieved through the use of case studies for introducing the various concepts of analysis and design, ensuring that the theory is never separate from the implementation aspects.

All the main case studies used in this book have been implemented by the authors using Java. An appendix on Java provides a useful short tutorial on the language.

## SPSS for Starters and 2nd Levelers#spss_for_starters_and_2nd_levelers
### **Ton J. Cleophas, Aeilko H. Zwinderman** 


  For medical and health workers this book is a must-have, because statistical methods in these fields are vital, and no equivalent work is available. For medical and health students this is equally true.



A unique point is its low threshold, textually simple and at the same time full of self-assessment opportunities. Other unique points are the succinctness of the chapters with 3 to 6 pages, the presence of entire-commands-texts of the statistical methodologies reviewed, and the fact that dull scientific texts imposing an unnecessary burden on busy and jaded professionals have been left out. For readers requesting more background, theoretical and mathematical information a note section with references is in each chapter.



The first edition in 2010 was the first publication of a complete overview of SPSS methodologies for medical and health statistics. Well over 100,000 copies of various chapters were sold within the first year of publication. Reasons for a rewrite were four.

First, many important comments from readers urged for a rewrite. Second, SPSS has produced many updates and upgrades, with relevant novel and improved methodologies. Third, the authors felt that the chapter texts needed some improvements for better readability: chapters have now been classified according the outcome data helpful for choosing your analysis rapidly, a schematic overview of data, and explanatory graphs have been added. Fourth, current data are increasingly

complex and many important methods for analysis were missing in the first edition. For that latter purpose some more advanced methods seemed unavoidable, like hierarchical loglinear methods, gamma and Tweedie regressions, and random intercept analyses. In order for the contents of the book to remain covered by the title, the authors renamed the book: SPSS for Starters and 2nd Levelers.

Special care was, nonetheless, taken to keep things as simple as possible. Medical and health professionals tend to dislike software syntax. Therefore, virtually no syntax, but, rather, simple menu commands are given. The arithmetic is still of a no-more-than high-school level. Step-by-step analyses of different statistical methodologies are given with the help of 60 SPSS data files available through the internet. Because of the lack of time of this busy group of people, the authors have given every effort to produce a text as succinct as possible.

## A Course in Rasch Measurement Theory#a_course_in_rasch_measurement_theory
### **David Andrich, Ida Marais** 


  This book applies Rasch measurement theory to the fields of education, psychology, sociology, marketing and health outcomes in order to measure various social constructs. The chief focus is on first principles of both the theory and its applications. Because software is readily available to carry out analyses of real data, numerous small examples are provided in the book. The software used in these examples, and which is helpful in working through the text, is RUMM2030 (Rasch unidimensional models for measurement).
The book’s main goals are to equip researchers with the confidence they need in order to be in control of the analysis and interpretation of data, and to make professional rather than primarily statistical decisions mechanically. Because statistical principles are necessarily involved, reviews of the requisite statistics are provided in the Appendix.
The content is based on courses that have been taught both online and in intensive form for over two decades. Although first principles are emphasised, much of the book is based on research conducted by the two authors and their colleagues.

## Customer Relationship Management#customer_relationship_management
### **V. Kumar, Werner Reinartz** 


  This book presents an extensive discussion of the strategic and tactical aspects of customer relationship management as we know it today. It helps readers obtain a comprehensive grasp of CRM strategy, concepts and tools and provides all the necessary steps in managing profitable customer relationships. Throughout, the book stresses a clear understanding of economic customer value as the guiding concept for marketing decisions. Exhaustive case studies, mini cases and real-world illustrations under the title “CRM at Work” all ensure that the material is both highly accessible and applicable, and help to address key managerial issues, stimulate thinking, and encourage problem solving. The book is a comprehensive and up-to-date learning companion for advanced undergraduate students, master's degree students, and executives who want a detailed and conceptually sound insight into the field of CRM. The new edition provides an updated perspective on the latest research results and incorporates the impact of the digital transformation on the CRM domain.

## Introduction to General Relativity#introduction_to_general_relativity
### **Cosimo Bambi** 


  Following the approach of Lev Landau and Evgenii Lifshitz, this book introduces the theory of special and general relativity with the Lagrangian formalism and the principle of least action. This method allows the complete theory to be constructed starting from a small number of assumptions, and is the most natural approach in modern theoretical physics. The book begins by reviewing Newtonian mechanics and Newtonian gravity with the Lagrangian formalism and the principle of least action, and then moves to special and general relativity. Most calculations are presented step by step, as is done on the board in class. The book covers recent advances in gravitational wave astronomy and provides a general overview of current lines of research in gravity. It also includes numerous examples and problems in each chapter.

## Bioinformatics for Evolutionary Biologists#bioinformatics_for_evolutionary_biologists
### **Bernhard Haubold, Angelika Börsch-Haubold** 


  This self-contained textbook covers fundamental aspects of sequence analysis in evolutionary biology, including sequence alignment, phylogeny reconstruction, and coalescent simulation. It addresses these aspects through a series of over 400 computer problems, ranging from elementary to research level to enable learning by doing. Students solve the problems in the same computational environment used for decades in science – the UNIX command line. This is available on all three major operating systems for PCs: Microsoft Windows, Mac-OSX, and Linux. To learn using this powerful system, students analyze sample sequence data by applying generic tools, bioinformatics software, and over 40 programs specifically written for this course. The solutions for all problems are included, making the book ideal for self-study. Problems are grouped into sections headed by an introduction and a list of new concepts and programs. By using practical computing to explore evolutionary concepts and sequence data, the book enables readers to tackle their own computational problems.

## Particles and Nuclei#particles_and_nuclei
### **Bogdan Povh, Klaus Rith, Christoph Scholz, Frank Zetsche, Werner Rodejohann** 


  This well-known introductory textbook gives a uniform presentation of nuclear and particle physics from an experimental point of view.



The first part, Analysis, is devoted to disentangling the substructure of matter. This part shows that experiments designed to uncover the substructures of nuclei and nucleons have a similar conceptual basis, and lead to the present picture of all matter being constructed from a small number of elementary building blocks and a small number of fundamental interactions.



The second part, Synthesis, shows how the elementary particles may be combined to build hadrons and nuclei. The fundamental interactions, which are responsible for the forces in all systems, become less and less evident in increasingly complex systems. Such systems are in fact dominated by many-body phenomena. A section on neutrino oscillations and one on nuclear matter at high temperatures bridge the field of "nuclear and particle physics" and "modem astrophysics and cosmology.



The seventh revised and extended edition includes new material, in particular the experimental verification of the Higgs particle at the LHC, recent results in neutrino physics, the violation of CP-symmetry in the decay of neutral B-mesons, the experimental investigations of the nucleon's spin structure and outstanding results of the HERA experiments in deep-inelastic electron- and positron-proton scattering. The concise text is based on lectures held at the University of Heidelberg and includes numerous exercises with worked answers. It has been translated into several languages and has become a standard reference for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses.

## Epidemiological Research: Terms and Concepts#epidemiological_research_terms_and_concepts
### **O. S. Miettinen** 


  This book is by a single author – someone who, after medical school, has devoted half-a-century of full-time effort to ever better understand both clinical and community medicine and the research that is needed to produce the scientific knowledge-base of these.

The book is organized so as to address in separate sections first the preparatory topics of medicine (clinical and epidemiological), science in general, and statistics (mathematical); then topics of epidemiological research proper; and, finally, topics of ‘meta-epidemiological’ clinical research. In those two main sections, a further grouping is based on the distraction between objects and methods of study. In this framework, the particular topics are addressed both descriptively and quasi-prescriptively, commonly with a number of explicatory annotations.

This book is intended to serve and a *handbook* for whomever is, in whatever way, concerned with epidemiological or ‘meta-epidemiological’ clinical research. But besides, it is intended to serve as a *textbook* for the students in introductory courses on ‘epidemiological’ research – to which end there is a suggested hierarchy of the concepts that might reasonably be covered.

## The Elements of Statistical Learning#the_elements_of_statistical_learning
### **Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, Jerome Friedman** 


  During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book.

This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (*p* bigger than *n*), including multiple testing and false discovery rates.

Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful *An Introduction to the Bootstrap*. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.

## Magnetic Interactions in Molecules and Solids#magnetic_interactions_in_molecules_and_solids
### **Coen de Graaf, Ria Broer** 


  This textbook is the second volume in the Theoretical Chemistry and Computational Modeling series and aims to explain the theoretical basis of magnetic interactions at a level that will be useful for master students in physical, inorganic and organic chemistry.

The book gives a treatment of magnetic interactions in terms of the phenomenological spin Hamiltonians that have been such powerful tools for chemistry and physics in the past half century, starting from the simple Heisenberg and Ising Hamiltonians and ending with Hamiltonians that include biquadratic, cyclic or anisotropic exchange. On the other hand, it also explains how quantum chemical methods, reaching from simple mean field methods to accurate models that include the effects of electron correlation and spin-orbit coupling, can help to understand the magnetic properties. Connecting the two perspectives is an essential aspect of the book, since it leads to a deeper understanding of the relation between physical phenomena and basic properties. It also makes clear that in many cases one can derive magnetic coupling parameters not only from experiment, but also from accurate *ab initio* calculations.

The book starts with introducing a selection of basic concepts and tools. Throughout the book the text is interlarded with exercises, stimulating the students to not only read but also verify the assertions and perform (parts of) the derivations by themselves. In addition, each chapter ends with a number of problems that can be used to check whether the material has been understood.
 






 [![Magnetic Interactions in Molecules and Solids](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Pdflogogt.png)](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-22951-5.pdf)
## Ordinary Differential Equations#ordinary_differential_equations
### **William A. Adkins, Mark G. Davidson** 


  Unlike most texts in differential equations, this textbook gives an early presentation of the Laplace transform, which is then used to motivate and develop many of the remaining differential equation concepts for which it is particularly well suited. For example, the standard solution methods for constant coefficient linear differential equations are immediate and simplified, and solution methods for constant coefficient systems are streamlined. By introducing the Laplace transform early in the text, students become proficient in its use while at the same time learning the standard topics in differential equations. The text also includes proofs of several important theorems that are not usually given in introductory texts. These include a proof of the injectivity of the Laplace transform and a proof of the existence and uniqueness theorem for linear constant coefficient differential equations.

Along with its unique traits, this text contains all the topics needed for a standard three- or four-hour, sophomore-level differential equations course for students majoring in science or engineering. These topics include: first order differential equations, general linear differential equations with constant coefficients, second order linear differential equations with variable coefficients, power series methods, and linear systems of differential equations. It is assumed that the reader has had the equivalent of a one-year course in college calculus.

## Argumentation Theory: A Pragma-Dialectical Perspective#argumentation_theory_a_pragma_dialectical_perspective
### **Frans H. van Eemeren** 


  The book offers a compact but comprehensive introductory overview of the crucial components of argumentation theory. In presenting this overview, argumentation is consistently approached from a pragma-dialectical perspective by viewing it pragmatically as a goal-directed communicative activity and dialectically as part of a regulated critical exchange aimed at resolving a difference of opinion. As a result, the book also systematically explains how the constitutive parts of the pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation, which are discussed in a number of separate publications, hang together.

The following crucial topics are discussed: (1) argumentation theory as a discipline; (2) the meta-theoretical principles of pragma-dialectics; (3) the model of a critical discussion aimed at resolving a difference of opinion; (4) fallacies as violations of a code of conduct for reasonable argumentative discourse; (5) descriptive research of argumentative reality; (6) analysis as theoretically-motivated reconstruction; (7) strategic manoeuvring aimed at combining achieving effectiveness with maintaining reasonableness; (8) the conventionalization of argumentative practices; (9) prototypical argumentative patterns; (10) pragma-dialectics amidst other approaches.

*Argumentation Theory: A Pragma-Dialectical Perspective* is clearly written and makes argumentation theory understandable to all scholars and advanced students interested in argumentation research.

## Managing Media and Digital Organizations#managing_media_and_digital_organizations
### **Eli M. Noam** 


  What does it take for success in the media business? Creativity, innovation, and performance, of course. Plus experience and good judgment. However, it also requires an understanding of the principles and tools of management. This book summarizes the major dimensions of a business school curriculum and applies them to the entire media, media-tech, and digital sectors. Its chapters cover—in a jargonless, non-technical way—the major management functions. First, *creating *a media product: the financing of projects and the management of technology, HR, production operations, intellectual assets, and government relations. Second, *harvesting *the product created: market research, marketing, pricing, and distribution. And third, is the *control* loop: media accounting and strategy planning. The book’s interdisciplinary approach goes beyond an industry-by-industry coverage and centers around management functions.

In the process, this book becomes an indispensable resource for those aiming for a career in the media and digital field, both in startups and established organizations. It is also a work that helps advance the entire field—the management of information resources and products—to a more central role in business analysis. This book is designed to help those already in the sector or those joining it to become creative managers and managerial creatives. It aims to make managers in this field more knowledgeable, less blinded by hype, more effective, more productive, and more responsible.

## Applied Predictive Modeling#applied_predictive_modeling
### **Max Kuhn, Kjell Johnson** 


  This text is intended for a broad audience as both an introduction to predictive models as well as a guide to applying them. Non-mathematical readers will appreciate the intuitive explanations of the techniques while an emphasis on problem-solving with real data across a wide variety of applications will aid practitioners who wish to extend their expertise. Readers should have knowledge of basic statistical ideas, such as correlation and linear regression analysis. While the text is biased against complex equations, a mathematical background is needed for advanced topics.

**Dr. Kuhn** is a Director of Non-Clinical Statistics at Pfizer Global R&D in Groton Connecticut. He has been applying predictive models in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic industries for over 15 years and is the author of a number of R packages.**


**Dr. Johnson** has more than a decade of statistical consulting and predictive modeling experience in pharmaceutical research and development. He is a co-founder of Arbor Analytics, a firm specializing in predictive modeling and is a former Director of Statistics at Pfizer Global R&D. His scholarly work centers on the application and development of statistical methodology and learning algorithms.**


*Applied Predictive Modeling* covers the overall predictive modeling process, beginning with the crucial steps of data preprocessing, data splitting and foundations of model tuning. The text then provides intuitive explanations

of numerous common and modern regression and classification techniques, always with an emphasis on illustrating and solving real data problems. Addressing practical concerns extends beyond model fitting to topics such as handling class imbalance, selecting predictors, and pinpointing causes of poor model performance—all of which are problems that occur frequently in practice.

The text illustrates all parts of the modeling process through many hands-on, real-life examples. And every chapter contains extensive R code for each step of the process. The data sets and corresponding code are available in the book’s companion AppliedPredictiveModeling R package, which is freely available on the CRAN archive.

This multi-purpose text can be used as an introduction to predictive models and the overall modeling process, a practitioner’s reference handbook, or as a text for advanced undergraduate or graduate level predictive modeling courses. To that end, each chapter contains problem sets to help solidify the covered concepts and uses data available in the book’s R package.

Readers and students interested in implementing the methods should have some basic knowledge of R. And a handful of the more advanced topics require some mathematical knowledge.

## ENZYMES: Catalysis, Kinetics and Mechanisms#enzymes_catalysis_kinetics_and_mechanisms
### **N.S.  Punekar** 


  This enzymology textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate students covers the syllabi of most universities where this subject is regularly taught. It focuses on the synchrony between the two broad mechanistic facets of enzymology: the chemical and the kinetic, and also highlights the synergy between enzyme structure and mechanism. Designed for self-study, it explains how to design enzyme experiments and subsequently analyze the data collected. The book is divided into five major sections: 1] Introduction to enzymes, 2] Practical aspects, 3] Kinetic Mechanisms, 4] Chemical Mechanisms, and 5] Enzymology Frontiers. Individual concepts are treated as stand-alone chapters; readers can explore any single concept with minimal cross-referencing to the rest of the book. Further, complex approaches requiring specialized techniques and involved experimentation (beyond the reach of an average laboratory) are covered in theory with suitable references to guide readers.The book provides students, researchers and academics in the broad area of biology with a sound theoretical and practical knowledge of enzymes. It also caters to those who do not have a practicing enzymologist to teach them the subject.

## Statics and Mechanics of Structures#statics_and_mechanics_of_structures
### **Steen Krenk, Jan Høgsberg** 


  The statics and mechanics of structures form a core aspect of civil engineering. This book provides an introduction to the subject, starting from classic hand-calculation types of analysis and gradually advancing to a systematic form suitable for computer implementation. It starts with statically determinate structures in the form of trusses, beams and frames. Instability is discussed in the form of the column problem - both the ideal column and the imperfect column used in actual column design. The theory of statically indeterminate structures is then introduced, and the force and deformation methods are explained and illustrated. An important aspect of the book’s approach is the systematic development of the theory in a form suitable for computer implementation using finite elements. This development is supported by two small computer programs, MiniTruss and MiniFrame, which permit static analysis of trusses and frames, as well as linearized stability analysis. The book’s final section presents related strength of materials subjects in greater detail; these include stress and strain, failure criteria, and normal and shear stresses in general beam flexure and in beam torsion.

The book is well-suited as a textbook for a two-semester introductory course on structures.

## Computational Physics#computational_physics
### **Philipp O.J. Scherer** 


  This textbook presents basic and advanced computational physics in a very didactic style. It contains very-well-presented and simple mathematical descriptions of many of the most important algorithms used in computational physics. Many clear mathematical descriptions of important techniques in computational physics are given. The first part of the book discusses the basic numerical methods. A large number of exercises and computer experiments allows to study the properties of these methods. The second part concentrates on simulation of classical and quantum systems. It uses a rather general concept for the equation of motion which can be applied to ordinary and partial differential equations. Several classes of integration methods are discussed including not only the standard Euler and Runge Kutta method but also multistep methods and the class of Verlet methods which is introduced by studying the motion in Liouville space. Besides the classical methods, inverse interpolation is discussed, together with the popular combined methods by Dekker and Brent and a not so well known improvement by Chandrupatla. A general chapter on the numerical treatment of differential equations provides methods of finite differences, finite volumes, finite elements and boundary elements together with spectral methods and weighted residual based methods. A comparison of several methods for quantum systems is performed, containing pseudo-spectral methods, finite differences methods, rational approximation to the time evolution operator, second order differencing and split operator methods.
The book gives simple but non trivial examples from a broad range of physical topics trying to give the reader insight into the numerical treatment but also the simulated problems. Rotational motion is treated in much detail to describe the motion of rigid rotors which can be just a simple spinning top or a collection of molecules or planets. The behaviour of simple quantum systems is studied thoroughly. One focus is on a two level system in an external field. Solution of the Bloch equations allows the simulation of a quantum bit and to understand elementary principles from quantum optics. As an example of a thermodynamic system, the Lennard Jones liquid is simulated. The principles of molecular dynamics are shown with practical simulations. A second thermodynamic topic is the Ising model in one and two dimensions. The solution of the Poisson Boltzman equation is discussed in detail which is very important in Biophysics as well as in semiconductor physics. Besides the standard finite element methods, also modern boundary element methods are discussed. Waves and diffusion processes are simulated. Different methods are compared with regard to their stability and efficiency. Random walk models are studied with application to basic polymer physics. Nonlinear systems are discussed in detail with application to population dynamics and reaction diffusion systems. The exercises to the book are realized as computer experiments. A large number of Java applets is provided. It can be tried out by the reader even without programming skills. The interested reader can modify the programs with the help of the freely available and platform independent programming environment "netbeans".

## Correctional Counseling and Treatment#correctional_counseling_and_treatment
### **Peter C. Kratcoski** 


  This book provides a comprehensive overview of the methods used in the Criminal Justice system in the United States to counsel and treat offenders. It is aimed at advanced undergraduate and early graduate-level students for courses in Correctional Treatment or Rehabilitation, or Community Corrections more broadly.

The sections in the book provide:

· Aims and Scope of Correctional Counseling and Treatment

· Tools that Corrections Workers Use (including counseling and case management)

· Behavioral Modification Treatments: Examples and Applications

· Cognitive Therapies: Examples and Applications

Throughout the text, there is an emphasis on the big picture: the interaction of the correctional component of the justice system with other components, particularly courts (including special courts like family courts, drug courts, veterans courts and other programs).Chapters in this book address the diverse population of correctional facilities, including juvenile offenders; those with mental illness, addiction and substance abuse problems, physical and mental disabilities; and homeless populations. The author also provides analysis of how legislation influences the corrections process.

This work is also enhanced by providing comparative analysis of the criminal and juvenile justice systems: their goals, objectives, and how these can affect counseling and treatment available within these two systems.

The pedagogical features of this engaging text include excerpted interviews with correctional practitioners about the problems and challenges they encounter, discussion questions, classification of institutions, current examples of specific treatment programs, and case studies that give students the chance to select the appropriate interviewing, counseling, and treatment approaches to deal with the problems, and stresses of applying these methods. Several chapters are co-authored by correctional practitioners.



This work provides students with an overview of the methods used for Correctional Treatment and Counseling, and the tools to begin to think critically about how and when to apply these methods.

## Search Methodologies#search_methodologies
### **Edmund K. Burke, Graham Kendall** 


  The first edition of *Search Methodologies: Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques* was originally put together to offer a basic introduction to the various search and optimization techniques that students might need to use during their research, and this new edition continues this tradition. *Search Methodologies* has been expanded and brought completely up to date, including new chapters covering scatter search, GRASP, and very large neighborhood search. The chapter authors are drawn from across Computer Science and Operations Research and include some of the world’s leading authorities in their field. The book provides useful guidelines for implementing the methods and frameworks described and offers valuable tutorials to students and researchers in the field.

*“As I embarked on the pleasant journey of reading through the chapters of this book, I became convinced that this is one of the best sources of introductory material on the search methodologies topic to be found. The book’s subtitle, “Introductory Tutorials in Optimization and Decision Support Techniques”, aptly describes its aim, and the editors and contributors to this volume have achieved this aim with remarkable success. The chapters in this book are exemplary in giving useful guidelines for implementing the methods and frameworks described.”*
Fred Glover, Leeds School of Business, University of Colorado Boulder, USA

*“[The book] aims to present a series of well written tutorials by the leading experts in their fields. Moreover, it does this by covering practically the whole possible range of topics in the discipline. It enables students and practitioners to study and appreciate the beauty and the power of some of the computational search techniques that are able to effectively navigate through search spaces that are sometimes inconceivably large. I am convinced that this second edition will build on the success of the first edition and that it will prove to be just as popular.”*

## Foundations for Designing User-Centered Systems#foundations_for_designing_user_centered_systems
### **Frank E. Ritter, Gordon D. Baxter, Elizabeth F. Churchill** 


  Interactive technologies pervade every aspect of modern life. Web sites, mobile devices, household gadgets, automotive controls, aircraft flight decks; everywhere you look, people are interacting with technologies. These interactions are governed by a combination of: the users’ capabilities; the things the users are trying to do; and the context in which they are trying to do them. All of these factors have to be appropriately considered during* design* if you want your technology to provide your users with a good experience.

*Foundations for Designing User-Centered Systems *introduces the fundamental human capabilities and characteristics that influence how people use interactive technologies. Organized into four main areas—anthropometrics, behaviour, cognition and social factors—it covers basic research and considers the practical implications of that research on system design. Applying what you learn from this book will help you to design interactive systems that are more usable, more useful and more effective.

The authors have deliberately developed *Foundations for Designing User-Centered Systems* to appeal to system designers and developers, as well as to students who are taking courses in system design and HCI. The book reflects the authors’ backgrounds in computer science, cognitive science, psychology and human factors. The material in the book is based on their collective experience which adds up to almost 90 years of working in academia and both with, and within, industry; covering domains that include aviation, consumer Internet, defense, eCommerce, enterprise system design, health care, and industrial process control.

*“The lack of accessible and comprehensive material on human factors for software engineers has been an important barrier to more widespread acceptance of a human-centered approach to systems design. This book has broken down that barrier and I can thoroughly recommend it to all engineers.”*

, University of St Andrews, UK

*“As a chief architect for large programs, this book has given me access to a variety of new techniques and an extended vocabulary that I look forward to introducing my design teams to.”*

**Richard Hopkins**, IBM, UK**


*“Even if only a proportion of designers and users read this book we will be so much better off. If it gets the circulation it deserves it could change our world–and that very much for the better.”*

**Peter Hancock**, University of Central Florida, USA**

## A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics#a_modern_introduction_to_probability_and_statistics
### **Frederik Michel Dekking, Cornelis Kraaikamp, Hendrik Paul Lopuhaä, Ludolf Erwin Meester** 


  Probability and Statistics are studied by most science students, usually as a second- or third-year course. Many current texts in the area are just cookbooks and, as a result, students do not know why they perform the methods they are taught, or why the methods work. The strength of this book is that it readdresses these shortcomings; by using examples, often from real-life and using real data, the authors can show how the fundamentals of probabilistic and statistical theories arise intuitively. It provides a tried and tested, self-contained course, that can also be used for self-study.

A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics has numerous quick exercises to give direct feedback to the students. In addition the book contains over 350 exercises, half of which have answers, of which half have full solutions. A website at www.springeronline.com/1-85233-896-2 gives access to the data files used in the text, and, for instructors, the remaining solutions. The only pre-requisite for the book is a first course in calculus; the text covers standard statistics and probability material, and develops beyond traditional parametric models to the Poisson process, and on to useful modern methods such as the bootstrap.

This will be a key text for undergraduates in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology and Business Studies who are studying a mathematical statistics course, and also for more intensive engineering statistics courses for undergraduates in all engineering subjects.

## Legal Dynamics of EU External Relations#legal_dynamics_of_eu_external_relations
### **Henri de Waele** 


  This book offers a concise yet comprehensive review of the principles of EU external relations law. By carefully examining the role of the Union on the global scene, it provides a systematic overview of the relevant rules and competences, reflecting on the legal developments in their political and societal context. In addition to up-to-date analyses of, inter alia, the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the Common Security and Defence Policy and the Common Commercial Policy, it highlights the EU's external powers with regard to the environment, fundamental rights and development cooperation. Moreover, it includes dedicated chapters exploring the relations with neighbouring countries, and explaining the complex interplay between rules of domestic, European and international provenance.

The second edition of this established text (the first edition was published under the title Layered Global Player in 2011) has been geared even more specifically towards students, for example through the inclusion of chapter overviews, clarifying boxes, and supplementary examples, while a meticulous review of the narrative has further enhanced its accessibility. As before, the book’s compact dimensions, transparent structure and engaging style of writing enable readers to master the main features of this gripping field of law with ease. It thus remains an invaluable resource for students and lecturers alike.

## Game Theory#game_theory
### **Hans Peters** 


  This textbook presents the basics of game theory both on an undergraduate level and on a more advanced mathematical level. It is the second, revised version of the successful 2008 edition. The book covers most topics of interest in game theory, including cooperative game theory. Part I presents introductions to all these topics on a basic yet formally precise level. It includes chapters on repeated games, social choice theory, and selected topics such as bargaining theory, exchange economies, and matching. Part II goes deeper into noncooperative theory and treats the theory of zerosum games, refinements of Nash equilibrium in strategic as well as extensive form games, and evolutionary games. Part III covers basic concepts in the theory of transferable utility games, such as core and balancedness, Shapley value and variations, and nucleolus. Some mathematical tools on duality and convexity are collected in Part IV. Every chapter in the book contains a problem section. Hints, answers and solutions are included.

## Integrated Neuroscience#integrated_neuroscience
### **Elliott M. Marcus, Stanley Jacobson** 


  This textbook takes as a premise that, in order to make intelligent diagnosis and provide a rational treatment in disorders of the nervous system, it is necessary to develop the capacity to answer the basic questions of clinical neurology:
(1) Where is the disease process located? (2) What is the nature of the disease process?
The purpose of this textbook is to enable the medical student to acquire the basic information of the neurosciences and neurology and most importantly the ability to apply that information to the solution of clinical problems. The authors also suggest that hospital trips be a part of any Clinical Neurosciences Course so that the student can put into actual practice what he has learned in the classroom.
We believe that this textbook will be of value to the student throughout the four years of the medical school curriculum. Medical, psychiatry and neurology residents may also find this text of value as an introduction or review.

## Physics from Symmetry#physics_from_symmetry
### **Jakob Schwichtenberg** 


  This is a textbook that derives the fundamental theories of physics from symmetry.
It starts by introducing, in a completely self-contained way, all mathematical tools needed to use symmetry ideas in physics. Thereafter, these tools are put into action and by using symmetry constraints, the fundamental equations of Quantum Mechanics, Quantum Field Theory, Electromagnetism, and Classical Mechanics are derived.

As a result, the reader is able to understand the basic assumptions behind, and the connections between the modern theories of physics. The book concludes with first applications of the previously derived equations.

Thanks to the input of readers from around the world, this second edition has been purged of typographical errors and also contains several revised sections with improved explanations.

## Linear and Nonlinear Programming#linear_and_nonlinear_programming
### **David G. Luenberger, Yinyu Ye** 


  This new edition covers the central concepts of practical optimization techniques, with an emphasis on methods that are both state-of-the-art and popular. Again a connection between the purely analytical character of an optimization problem and the behavior of algorithms used to solve the problem. As in the earlier editions, the material in this fourth edition is organized into three separate parts. Part I is a self-contained introduction to linear programming covering numerical algorithms and many of its important special applications. Part II, which is independent of Part I, covers the theory of unconstrained optimization, including both derivations of the appropriate optimality conditions and an introduction to basic algorithms. Part III extends the concepts developed in the second part to constrained optimization problems. It is possible to go directly into Parts II and III omitting Part I, and, in fact, the book has been used in this way in many universities.



*From the reviews of the Third Edition*

* *

“….this very well-written book is a classic textbook in Optimization. It should be present in the bookcase of each student, researcher, and specialist from the host of disciplines from which practical optimization applications are drawn.” (Jean-Jacques Strodiot, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol.1207, 2011).

## Time Series Econometrics#time_series_econometrics
### **Klaus Neusser** 


  This text presents modern developments in time series analysis and focuses on their application to economic problems. The book first introduces the fundamental concept of a stationary time series and the basic properties of covariance, investigating the structure and estimation of autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) models and their relations to the covariance structure. The book then moves on to non-stationary time series, highlighting its consequences for modeling and forecasting and presenting standard statistical tests and regressions. Next, the text discusses volatility models and their applications in the analysis of financial market data, focusing on generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) models. The second part of the text devoted to multivariate processes, such as vector autoregressive (VAR) models and structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) models, which have become the main tools in empirical macroeconomics. The text concludes with a discussion of co-integrated models and the Kalman Filter, which is being used with increasing frequency. Mathematically rigorous, yet application-oriented, this self-contained text will help students develop a deeper understanding of theory and better command of the models that are vital to the field. Assuming a basic knowledge of statistics and/or econometrics, this text is best suited for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students.

## Perceptual Organization#perceptual_organization
### **Stephen Handel** 


  This textbook goes beyond introductory sensory perception by incorporating supplementary electronic materials to demonstrate the parallels between both hearing and seeing. Each chapter intermixes seeing and hearing processes so that students can easily understand that perceptual organization is the same across different kinds of sensations and modalities. Figures illustrating visual organization are paired with sound files demonstrating the analogous auditory organization. While most books on sensation and/or perception treat the senses individually there is growing awareness of just how important multisensory integration is to understanding the connection between sensory perception and cognition.

## Multivariate Calculus and Geometry#multivariate_calculus_and_geometry
### **Seán Dineen** 


  Multivariate calculus can be understood best by combining geometric insight, intuitive arguments, detailed explanations and mathematical reasoning. This textbook has successfully followed this programme. It additionally provides a solid description of the basic concepts, via familiar examples, which are then tested in technically demanding situations.

In this new edition the introductory chapter and two of the chapters on the geometry of surfaces have been revised. Some exercises have been replaced and others provided with expanded solutions.

Familiarity with partial derivatives and a course in linear algebra are essential prerequisites for readers of this book. *Multivariate Calculus and Geometry* is aimed primarily at higher level undergraduates in the mathematical sciences. The inclusion of many practical examples involving problems of several variables will appeal to mathematics, science and engineering students.

## LGBT-Parent Families#lgbt_parent_families
### **Abbie E. Goldberg, Katherine R. Allen** 


  “This first-rate handbook provides a comprehensive, astute, and accessible view of LGBT-parent families. With contributions from an interdisciplinary and international group of leading scholars, this volume covers every contemporary topic concerning LGBT families, including transgender parenting and LGBTQ youth with LGBTQ parents. Co-editors Drs. Goldberg and Allen have done an outstanding job in assembling experts to present overviews of the research and suggest applications for clinical work, policy, and advocacy. I highly recommend that this book be included in college and post-graduate social science courses on family life. This manual is essential reading for all clinicians.” - *Nanette Gartrell, MD, Williams Institute Visiting Distinguished Scholar, UCLA School of Law, Principal Investigator, U.S. National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study*

“The appearance of a handbook on LGBT-parent families signals and advances the mainstreaming of a category of family that just a short time ago was utterly marginal, subversive, even illegal.”—from the Foreword by Judith Stacey, Ph.D.

Paralleling their gains in legal rights and social acceptance is a rapidly growing knowledge base concerning sexually diverse families. Emphasizing what we know and what we still need to know about this maturing field, *LGBT-Parent Families *covers both major and less-studied areas of research, exploring clinical, methodological, policy, and advocacy issues alongside the contexts in which parents practice their craft and children experience their world. Inclusiveness beyond sexuality and gender is a crucial dimension of this volume: issues of race/ethnicity, social class, and geographic diversity are discussed by most of the contributors, including a chapter devoted to non-Western perspectives. Diverse, too, are the disciplines represented in the book, from psychology and psychiatry to human development and legal studies. Among the topics covered:

* Lesbian and gay adoptive parents
* A call for research on bisexual parenting
* Transgender-parent families
* LGBTQ youth with LGBTQ parents
* Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender grandparents
* Clinical work with LGBTQ parents and prospective parents
* Qualitative research on LGBT-parent families
* Use of representative datasets to study LGBT-parent families
* Use of multilevel modeling to study LGBT-parent families
Geared toward researchers in family relations, family sociology, and public health as well as to policymakers and clinicians, *LGBT-Parent Families *breaks progressive new ground with an eye toward an egalitarian future.

## An Anthology of London in Literature, 1558-1914#an_anthology_of_london_in_literature_1558_1914
### **Geoffrey G. Hiller, Peter L. Groves, Alan F. Dilnot** 


  This book is an anthology of extracts of literary writing (in prose, verse and drama) about London and its diverse inhabitants, taken from the accession of Queen Elizabeth I in 1558 to the outbreak of the Great War in 1914. The 143 extracts, divided into four periods (1558-1659, 1660-1780, 1781-1870 and 1871-1914), range from about 250 words to 2,500. Each of the four periods has an introduction that deals with relevant social, geographical and historical developments, and each extract is introduced with a contextualizing headnote and furnished with explanatory footnotes. In addition, the general introduction to the anthology addresses some of the literary questions that arise in writing about London, and the book ends with many suggestions for further reading. It should appeal not only to the general reader interested in London and its representation, but also to students of literature in courses about ‘reading the city’.

## Computational Physics#computational_physics
### **Philipp O.J. Scherer** 


  This textbook presents basic numerical methods and applies them to a large variety of physical models in multiple computer experiments. Classical algorithms and more recent methods are explained. Partial differential equations are treated generally comparing important methods, and equations of motion are solved by a large number of simple as well as more sophisticated methods. Several modern algorithms for quantum wavepacket motion are compared. The first part of the book discusses the basic numerical methods, while the second part simulates classical and quantum systems. Simple but non-trivial examples from a broad range of physical topics offer readers insights into the numerical treatment but also the simulated problems. Rotational motion is studied in detail, as are simple quantum systems. A two-level system in an external field demonstrates elementary principles from quantum optics and simulation of a quantum bit. Principles of molecular dynamics are shown. Modern bounda

ry element methods are presented in addition to standard methods, and waves and diffusion processes are simulated comparing the stability and efficiency of different methods. A large number of computer experiments is provided, which can be tried out even by readers with no programming skills. Exercises in the applets complete the pedagogical treatment in the book. In the third edition Monte Carlo methods and random number generation have been updated taking recent developments into account. Krylov-space methods for eigenvalue problems are discussed in much more detail. The wavelet transformation method has been included as well as simple applications to continuum mechanics and convection-diffusion problems. Lastly, elementary quantum many-body problems demonstrate the application of variational and Monte-Carlo methods.

## Microeconomics#microeconomics
### **Peter Dorman** 


  The world has changed dramatically in recent years and so has the field of economics, but many introductory economics textbooks have remained stuck in the past. This book provides a new beginning for the study of microeconomics, emphasizing current debates and research trends. It is international in outlook and reflects the shift toward empirical methods, as well as the study of institutions and economic behavior. It is also written to fit in with an approach to teaching based on active learning and critical thinking. Mainstream material is still covered, but within a new context, making it more relevant, realistic and responsive to the deeper questions economists are now asking about theory and policy. Economics as a discipline is viewed from a broad perspective that takes into account new developments at the intersections with psychology, political science, the natural sciences and philosophy. Economics as presented in this text is less sure that it has all the answers, but it is more interesting, application-oriented and open to new ideas.

"Fundamentals in Biomechanics delivers everything it promises, and more. The challenge of teaching and learning biomechanics is understanding the two distinct fields that it comprises - biology and mechanics. In my experience, some students enter biomechanics with aptitude and interest in one of these fields and reluctance to the others. As a leader in biomechanics, Dr. Knudson seems to realize this and does an expert job of teaching these two fields in separate parts of the textbook. The text is clearly written, and includes many helpful illustrations and examples."
Glenn S. Fleisig, Ph.D., Smith and Nephew Chair of Research, American Sports Medicine Institute, Birmingham, AL
"Fundamentals of Biomechanics is a wonderful and comprehensive treatment which meets the needs and interest of both students and educators! The text addresses the subject cohesively and solidly in a technical, yet very readable and effective manner...I'll use this text in my own summer course and recommend it to colleagues."
Jani Macari Pallis, Ph.D., International Sports Engineering Association, San Francisco, CA

## Principles of Quantum Mechanics#principles_of_quantum_mechanics
### **R. Shankar** 


  Reviews from the First Edition:

"An excellent text … The postulates of quantum mechanics and the mathematical underpinnings are discussed in a clear, succinct manner." (American Scientist)

"No matter how gently one introduces students to the concept of Dirac’s bras and kets, many are turned off. Shankar attacks the problem head-on in the first chapter, and in a very informal style suggests that there is nothing to be frightened of." (Physics Bulletin)

Reviews of the Second Edition:

"This massive text of 700 and odd pages has indeed an excellent get-up, is very verbal and expressive, and has extensively worked out calculational details---all just right for a first course. The style is conversational, more like a corridor talk or lecture notes, though arranged as a text. … It would be particularly useful to beginning students and those in allied areas like quantum chemistry." (Mathematical Reviews)



- Clear, accessible treatment of underlying mathematics

- A review of Newtonian, Lagrangian, and Hamiltonian mechanics

- Student understanding of quantum theory is enhanced by separate treatment of mathematical theorems and physical postulates

- Unsurpassed coverage of path integrals and their relevance in contemporary physics

The requisite text for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level students, Principles of Quantum Mechanics, Second Edition is fully referenced and is supported by many exercises and solutions. The book’s self-contained chapters also make it suitable for independent study as well as for courses in applied disciplines.

## Evidence-Based Critical Care#evidence_based_critical_care
### **Robert C. Hyzy** 


  This textbook approaches the study of critical care with teaching in mind. In medicine “teachable moments” usually occur in clinical context, where the engagement in a real case exemplifies principles of diagnosis or therapy. In order to replicate the teaching method, selected cases are presented within each chapter offering the reader an opportunity to process and reflect on the components of the topic within a practical scenario.
While medical practice attempts to be evidence-based, common approaches to diagnosis and management incorporate not only evidence but heuristics and biases which await either validation or repudiation. Hence, each chapter is divided into two segments: the “Principles of Management” section – the common approach to the care of patients having a given condition is presented – and the “Evidence Contour” section, in which each author discusses the aspects of diagnosis and management that are the subject of ongoing debate.
Evidence-Based Critical Care: A Case Study Approach bridges the gulf between the traditional encyclopedic textbook and the single-hit online repository. This approach will help critical care practitioners, fellows, residents, allied health professionals and students expand their critical care knowledge in an efficient and effective manner, while being especially important for those preparing for board examinations.

It includes 14 new contributions and presents a comprehensive, state-of-the-art treatment of cutting-edge methods and topics, such as collateralized debt obligations, the high-frequency analysis of market liquidity, and realized volatility.

The book is divided into three parts: Part 1 revisits important market risk issues, while Part 2 introduces novel concepts in credit risk and its management along with updated quantitative methods. The third part discusses the dynamics of risk management and includes risk analysis of energy markets and for cryptocurrencies. Digital assets, such as blockchain-based currencies, have become popular b

ut are theoretically challenging when based on conventional methods. Among others, it introduces a modern text-mining method called dynamic topic modeling in detail and applies it to the message board of Bitcoins.

The unique synthesis of theory and practice supported by computational tools is reflected not only in the selection of topics, but also in the fine balance of scientific contributions on practical implementation and theoretical concepts. This link between theory and practice offers theoreticians insights into considerations of applicability and, vice versa, provides practitioners convenient access to new techniques in quantitative finance. Hence the book will appeal both to researchers, including master and PhD students, and practitioners, such as financial engineers. The results presented in the book are fully reproducible and all quantlets needed for calculations are provided on an accompanying website.

## Handbook of the Sociology of Gender#handbook_of_the_sociology_of_gender
### **Janet Saltzman Chafetz** 


  During the past three decades, feminist scholars in almost all social and behavioral sciences, as well as the humanities, have successfully demonstrated the ubiquity and omnirelevance of gender as a socio-cultural construction in virtually all human collectives, past and present. Gender shapes and is shaped in all arenas of social life, from the most mundane practices of everyday life to those of the most powerful corporate actors.

In this seminal work, the contributors focus on sociological theories and research concerning gender, which are discussed across the full array of social processes, structures and institutions. In each chapter, focus is placed on gender rather than on women alone, and copious cross-national and historical material is utilized in addition to an in-depth focus on contemporary North America.

Sections include:

I: Basic Issues

II: Macrostructures and Processes

III: Microstructures and Processes

IV: Institutions

Each of these viewpoints survey the field in a critical manner, evaluating theoretical models in light of the best available empirical evidence. Distinctively sociological approaches are highlighted by means of explicit comparison to perspectives characterizing related disciplines such as psychology, psychiatry, and anthropology. This volume seeks to record where the field has been, to identify its current location and to plot its course for the future.

## Social Marketing in Action#social_marketing_in_action
### **Debra Z. Basil, Gonzalo Diaz-Meneses, Michael D. Basil** 


  This textbook provides students with real-world social marketing case studies from different countries and regions around the world, taking learners from classroom theory to practice. The primary objective is to clearly portray to students distinct, identifiable steps that are essential for successful social marketing campaigns. Core social marketing practices are applied to each case to help students master social marketing principles and apply them to their own real world social marketing activities in order to affect positive social change.

This textbook first provides the tools necessary to understand the effective applica- tion of social marketing, and then offers 24 case studies exemplifying effective social marketing efforts from all around the world. Specifically, Part I clearly and concisely explains the principles of social marketing in five chapters:

• Upstream vs. downstream social marketing, SWOT, competition • Fundamentals of social marketing, ethics

• Formative and Evaluative Research

• Theories applied in social marketing

• A historical perspective on social marketing

Part II features 24 social marketing case studies that demonstrate the application of social marketing principles. All 24 cases follow a consistent structure that includes:

• Background • Positioning

• SWOT • Research

• Objectives • The 4 P’s

• Target audience • Evaluation

• Barriers and benefits • Discussion

• Competition

This format allows for students and professors to easily and effectively select individual cases and compare between cases. This textbook also allows instructors to encourage critical thinking by having students compare and contrast not only the cases themselves, but the applications used. In addition, teaching guides with answers to discussion questions, suggestions for activities inside and outside of the classroom and further readings are available to assist professors in teaching from this book.

## The Action Research Planner#the_action_research_planner
### **Stephen Kemmis, Robin McTaggart, Rhonda Nixon** 


  A fully-updated and reworked version of the classic book by Stephen Kemmis and Robin McTaggart​, now joined by Rhonda Nixon, *The Action Research Planner *is a detailed guide to developing and conducting a critical participatory action research project. The authors outline new views on ‘participation’ (based on Jürgen Habermas’s notion of a ‘public sphere’), ‘practice’ (as shaped by practice architectures), and ‘research’ (as research within practice traditions). They provide five extended examples of critical participatory action research studies. The book includes a range of resources for people planning a critical participatory research initiative, providing guidance on how to establish an action research group and identify a shared concern, research ethics, principles of procedure for action researchers, protocols for collaborative work, keeping a journal, gathering evidence, reporting, and choosing academic partners.

Unlike earlier editions, *The Action Research Planner* focuses specifically on critical participatory action research, which occupies a particular (critical) niche in the action research 'family'.

*The Action Research Planner *is an essential guide to planning and undertaking this type of research.

## Introduction to Smooth Manifolds#introduction_to_smooth_manifolds
### **John M. Lee** 


  This book is an introductory graduate-level textbook on the theory of smooth manifolds. Its goal is to familiarize students with the tools they will need in order to use manifolds in mathematical or scientific research—smooth structures, tangent vectors and covectors, vector bundles, immersed and embedded submanifolds, tensors, differential forms, de Rham cohomology, vector fields, flows, foliations, Lie derivatives, Lie groups, Lie algebras, and more. The approach is as concrete as possible, with pictures and intuitive discussions of how one should think geometrically about the abstract concepts, while making full use of the powerful tools that modern mathematics has to offer.

This second edition has been extensively revised and clarified, and the topics have been substantially rearranged. The book now introduces the two most important analytic tools, the rank theorem and the fundamental theorem on flows, much earlier so that they can be used throughout the book. A few new topics have been added, notably Sard’s theorem and transversality, a proof that infinitesimal Lie group actions generate global group actions, a more thorough study of first-order partial differential equations, a brief treatment of degree theory for smooth maps between compact manifolds, and an introduction to contact structures.

Prerequisites include a solid acquaintance with general topology, the fundamental group, and covering spaces, as well as basic undergraduate linear algebra and real analysis.

***“I am privileged to write the Foreword to this fifth edition of Ladd and Palmer’s Structure Determination by X-ray Crystallography, a textbook that is now world renowned and that has helped educate two generations of crystallographers in the theory and practice of modern crystallography, myself included . . . . For the interdisciplinary students of today seeking a thorough and detailed understanding of the principles and methods of modern crystallography, Ladd and Palmer remains as essential and relevant today as when it first appeared some 35 years ago. . . . . Extending the scope of this classic text beyond the purely X-ray Crystallography of its title to include diffraction of other radiations acknowledges some of the new frontiers and ever increasing impact of crystallographic analysis in structural sciences. As has been the case for the last 35 years, Ladd and Palmer is set to educate and equip the students of today to drive and inspire the developments of tomorrow!”**

*Dean A. A. Myles, Neutron Sciences Directorate, Oak Ridge National Laboratory

**From the Foreword to the 4th Edition**

***“Now there are many books on crystallography and structure determination out there, but Ladd & Palmer is probably unique in being the most thorough treatment you are going to find. The book takes you right through from simple beginnings up to the most recent ideas in macromolecular crystallography. This Fourth Edition is a substantial and scholarly work that deserves to be on the shelves of anyone wishing to determine crystal structures. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to recommend it to you.”**

## Polymer Chemistry#polymer_chemistry
### **Sebastian Koltzenburg, Michael Maskos, Oskar Nuyken** 


  This comprehensive textbook describes the synthesis, characterization and technical and engineering applications of polymers. Offering a broad and balanced introduction to the basic concepts of macromolecular chemistry and to the synthesis and physical chemistry of polymers, it is the ideal text for graduate students and advanced Masters students starting out in polymer science. Building on the basic principles of organic chemistry and thermodynamics, it provides an easily understandable and highly accessible introduction to the topic. Step by step, readers will obtain a detailed and well-founded understanding of this vibrant and increasingly important subject area at the intersection between chemistry, physics, engineering and the life sciences.Following a different approach than many other textbooks in the field, the authors, with their varying backgrounds (both from academia and industry), offer a new perspective. Starting with a clear and didactic introduction, the book discusses basic terms and sizes and shapes of polymers and macromolecules. There then follow chapters dedicated to polymers in solutions, molar mass determination, and polymers in the solid state, incl. (partially) crystalline or amorphous polymers as well as their application as engineering materials. Based on this information, the authors explain the most important polymerization methods and techniques. Often neglected in other textbooks, there are chapters on technical polymers, functional polymers, elastomers and liquid crystalline polymers, as well as polymers and the environment. An overview of current trends serves to generate further interest in present and future developments in the field.This book is the English translation of the successful German textbook "Polymere", which was awarded the Chemical Industry in Germany’s 2015 literature Prize (“Literaturpreis des Fonds der Chemischen Industrie”) for its innovative, novel approach, and its good accessibility and readability, while at the same time providing comprehensive coverage of the field of polymer science.

## Acquired Brain Injury#acquired_brain_injury
### **Jean Elbaum, Deborah M. Benson** 


  Regardless of etiology, such as accident, tumor, stroke or assault, acquired brain injury presents numerous challenges for survivors, caregivers and treating professionals. Interdisciplinary and integrated evaluations, treatment, and management can mean the difference between successful recovery and unfortunate outcomes.

The first book to present a comprehensive team approach to rehabilitation of ABI survivors, *Acquired Brain Injury* gives medical and clinical specialists a deeper understanding of not only each others' roles, but also their complementary functions.

-The medical management of ABI—neurosurgery, neurology, physiatry—and the medical specialties involved—neuropsychiatry, neurourology, and neuro-optometry

-In-depth discussion of the roles of occupational, speech-language, and balance therapies

-Separate chapters on nursing, neuropsychology, and case management



-Behavioral and emotional challenges common to individuals with ABI     -The importance of addressing family needs

-Long-term challenges

-Case examples throughout illustrating a wide range of injuries, symptoms, and stages of recovery

Based on the editors’ combined experience of more than 40 years in the neuro-rehabilitation field, this comprehensive volume clarifies rehabilitation goals and processes for the physician, rehab specialist, the advanced student, and patients’ advocates. With ABI so prevalent—roughly 1.5 million new cases per year—this book couldn’t be more timely.

## Electronic Commerce 2018#electronic_commerce_2018
### **Efraim Turban, Jon Outland, David King, Jae Kyu Lee, Ting-Peng Liang, Deborrah C. Turban** 


  This new Edition of *Electronic Commerce* is a complete update of the leading graduate level/advanced undergraduate level textbook on the subject. Electronic commerce (EC) describes the manner in which transactions take place over electronic networks, mostly the Internet. It is the process of electronically buying and selling goods, services, and information. Certain EC applications, such as buying and selling stocks and airline tickets online, are reaching maturity, some even exceeding non-Internet trades. However, EC is not just about buying and selling; it also is about electronically communicating, collaborating, and discovering information. It is about e-learning, e-government, social networks, and much more. EC is having an impact on a significant portion of the world, affecting businesses, professions, trade, and of course, people.

The most important developments in EC since 2014 are the continuous phenomenal growth of social networks, especially Facebook , LinkedIn and Instagram, and the trend toward conducting EC with mobile devices. Other major developments are the expansion of EC globally, especially in China where you can find the world's largest EC company. Much attention is lately being given to smart commerce and the use of AI-based analytics and big data to enhance the field. Finally, some emerging EC business models are changing industries (e.g., the shared economy models of Uber and Airbnb). The 2018 (9th) edition, brings forth the latest trends in e-commerce, including smart commerce, social commerce, social collaboration, shared economy, innovations, and mobility.

## Fluid Dynamics#fluid_dynamics
### **Michel Rieutord** 


  This book is dedicated to readers who want to learn fluid dynamics from the beginning. It assumes a basic level of mathematics knowledge that would correspond to that of most second-year undergraduate physics students and examines fluid dynamics from a physicist’s perspective. As such, the examples used primarily come from our environment on Earth and, where possible, from astrophysics. The text is arranged in a progressive and educational format, aimed at leading readers from the simplest basics to more complex matters like turbulence and magnetohydrodynamics. Exercises at the end of each chapter help readers to test their understanding of the subject (solutions are provided at the end of the book), and a special chapter is devoted to introducing selected aspects of mathematics that beginners may not be familiar with, so as to make the book self-contained.

## Understanding Cryptography#understanding_cryptography
### **Christof Paar, Jan Pelzl** 


  Cryptography is now ubiquitous – moving beyond the traditional environments, such as government communications and banking systems, we see cryptographic techniques realized in Web browsers, e-mail programs, cell phones, manufacturing systems, embedded software, smart buildings, cars, and even medical implants. Today's designers need a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography.

After an introduction to cryptography and data security, the authors explain the main techniques in modern cryptography, with chapters addressing stream ciphers, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and 3DES, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), block ciphers, the RSA cryptosystem, public-key cryptosystems based on the discrete logarithm problem, elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC), digital signatures, hash functions, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), and methods for key establishment, including certificates and public-key infrastructure (PKI). Throughout the book, the authors focus on communicating the essentials and keeping the mathematics to a minimum, and they move quickly from explaining the foundations to describing practical implementations, including recent topics such as lightweight ciphers for RFIDs and mobile devices, and current key-length recommendations.

The authors have considerable experience teaching applied cryptography to engineering and computer science students and to professionals, and they make extensive use of examples, problems, and chapter reviews, while the book’s website offers slides, projects and links to further resources. This is a suitable textbook for graduate and advanced undergraduate courses and also for self-study by engineers.
